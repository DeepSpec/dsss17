(** * 2. Small-step semantics.  *)

Reserved Notation " c '/' st '==>' c' '/' st' " (at level 40, st at level 39, c' at level 39).

(** In small-step style, the semantics is presented as a one-step reduction
  relation [ c / st --> c' / st' ], meaning that the command [c],
  executed in initial state [st'], performs one elementary step of computation.
  [st'] is the updated state after this step.
  [c'] is the residual command, capturing all the computations that
  remain to be done.

  A small-step semantics for Imp is given in file [sf/Smallstep.v], where
  not only the execution of commands is broken in individual steps,
  but also the evaluation of arithmetic and boolean expressions.
  We depart from this semantics by still treating the evaluation
  of arithmetic and boolean expressions as one atomic "big-step"
  (cf. rules [CS_Ass], [CS_IfTrue] and [CS_IfFalse] below).
  Non-atomic evaluation of expressions makes a difference in the case
  of parallel (interleaved) execution of several commands.  In a purely
  sequential setting, it is equivalent (and much simpler) to
  evaluate expressions in one atomic step, since their evaluations
  always terminate.

(** In small-step style, the semantics of a command [c] in a state [st]

- Infinite sequences: infinitely many reductions.

These sequences are defined using the generic [star] and [infseq] operators
over binary relations, which are defined in module [Sequences], along

(** * 3. Small-step semantics with continuations. *)

(** We now introduce an alternate form of the small-step semantics above
  where the command to be reduced is explicitly decomposed into:
- a sub-command under focus, where computation takes place;
- a continuation (or context) describing the position of this sub-command
  in the whole command, or, equivalently, describing the parts of the
  whole command that remain to be reduced once the sub-command is done.

As a consequence, the small-step semantics is presented as a transition relation
between triples (subcommand-under-focus, continuation, state).
Previously, we had transitions between pairs (whole-command, state).

The syntax of continuations is as follows:
*)

Inductive cont : Type :=
  | Kstop : cont
  | Kseq : com -> cont -> cont
  | Kwhile : bexp -> com -> cont -> cont.

(** Intuitive meaning of these constructors:
- [Kstop] means that, after the sub-command under focus terminates, nothing remains to
  be done, and execution can stop.  In other words, the sub-command under
  focus is the whole command.
- [Kseq c k] means that, after the sub-command terminates, we still need
  to execute command [c] in sequence, then continue as described by [k].
- [Kwhile b c k] means that, after the sub-command terminates, we still need
  to execute a loop [WHILE b DO c END], then continue as described by [k].
*)

(** Another way to forge intuitions about continuations is to ponder the following
  [apply_cont k c] function, which takes a sub-command [c] under focus
  and a continuation [k], and rebuilds the whole command.  It simply
  puts [c] in lefmost position in a nest of sequences as described by [k].
*)

Fixpoint apply_cont (k: cont) (c: com) : com :=
  match k with
  | Kstop => c
  | Kseq c1 k1 => apply_cont k1 (c ;; c1)
  | Kwhile b1 c1 k1 => apply_cont k1 (c ;; WHILE b1 DO c1 END)
  end.

(** Transitions between (subcommand-under-focus, continuation, state) triples
  perform conceptually different kinds of actions:
- Computation: evaluate an arithmetic expression or boolean expression
  and modify the triple according to the result of the evaluation.
- Focusing: replace the sub-command by a sub-sub-command that is to be
  evaluated next, possibly enriching the continuation as a consequence.
- Resumption: when the sub-command is [SKIP] and therefore fully executed,
  look at the head of the continuation to see what to do next.

Here are the transition rules, classified by the kinds of actions they implement.
*)

Inductive kstep : (com * cont * state) -> (com * cont * state) -> Prop :=

  | KS_Ass : forall st i a k n,            (**r Computation for assignments *)
      aeval st a = n ->
      kstep ((i ::= a), k, st) (SKIP, k, t_update st i n)

  | KS_Seq : forall st c1 c2 k,  (**r Focusing on the left part of a sequence *)
      kstep ((c1 ;; c2), k, st) (c1, Kseq c2 k, st)

  | KS_IfTrue : forall st b c1 c2 k,  (**r Computation for conditionals *)
      beval st b = true ->
      kstep (IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI, k, st) (c1, k, st)
  | KS_IfFalse : forall st b c1 c2 k,
      beval st b = false ->
      kstep (IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI, k, st) (c2, k, st)

  | KS_WhileTrue : forall st b c k,  (**r Computation and focusing for loops *)
      beval st b = true ->
      kstep (WHILE b DO c END, k, st) (c, Kwhile b c k, st)
  | KS_WhileFalse : forall st b c k,
      beval st b = false ->
      kstep (WHILE b DO c END, k, st) (SKIP, k, st)

  | KS_SkipSeq: forall c k st,  (**r Resumption on [SKIP] *)
      kstep (SKIP, Kseq c k, st) (c, k, st)
  | KS_SkipWhile: forall b c k st,
      kstep (SKIP, Kwhile b c k, st) (WHILE b DO c END, k, st).

(** Note: the [kstep] relation is not inductive, in the sense that the premises
  of the rules never involve the [kstep] relation itself.  Contrast with
  the [cstep] relation, which is recursive in the [CS_SeqStep] case:
<<
  | CS_SeqStep : forall st c1 c1' st' c2,
      c1 / st ==> c1' / st' ->
      (c1 ; c2) / st ==> (c1' ; c2) / st'
>>
  For [cstep], this rule enables us to reduce "deep" within a sequence.
  In contrast, [kstep] always reduce at the top of the given [(c,k,st)] triple.
  Reducting within a sequence is achieved by first focusing on the left
  part of the sequence (rule [KS_Seq]), bringing it to the top of the triple,
  then working on this left part.
*)

(** As in section 2, we can define the behavior of a command in terms of
  sequences of [kstep] reductions.
  Initial configurations are of the form (whole-command, [Kstop], initial-state).
  Final configurations are ([SKIP], [Kstop], final-state).  *)

Definition kterminates (c: com) (st: state) (st': state) : Prop :=
  star kstep (c, Kstop, st) (SKIP, Kstop, st').

Definition kdiverges (c: com) (st: state) : Prop :=
  infseq kstep (c, Kstop, st).

(** ** Extensions to other control structures *)

(** A remarkable feature of continuation semantics is that they extend very easily
  to other control structures besides "if-then-else" and "while" loops.
  Consider for instance the "break" construct of C, C++ and Java, which
  immediately terminates the nearest enclosing "while" loop.  Assume we
  extend the type of commands with a [BREAK] constructor.  Then, all we need
  to give "break" a semantics is to add two resumption rules:
<<
  | KS_BreakSeq: forall c k st,
      kstep (BREAK, Kseq c k, st) (BREAK, k, st)
  | KS_BreakWhile: forall b c k st,
      kstep (BREAK, Kwhile b c k, st) (SKIP, k, st)
>>
  The first rule says that a [BREAK] statement "floats up" pending sequences,
  skipping over the computations they contain.  Eventually, a [Kwhile]
  continuation is encountered, meaning that the [BREAK] found its enclosing
  loop.  Then, the second rule discards the [Kwhile] continuation and
  turns the [BREAK] into a [SKIP], effectively terminating the loop.
  That's all there is to it!
**)

(** If you're curious about adding "break" to the big-step semantics of
  section 1, see exercise [BreakImp] in the [Imp] module of
  Software Foundations. *)

(** *** Exercise (2 stars, recommended) *)
(** Besides "break", C, C++ and Java also have a "continue" statement
  that terminates the current iteration of the enclosing loop,
  then resumes the loop at its next iteration (instead of stopping
  the loop like "break" does). Give the transition rules
  for the "continue" statement. *)

(** *** Exercise (3 stars, optional) *)
(** In Java, loops as well as "break" and "continue" statements carry
  an optional label.  "break" without a label exits out of the immediately
  enclosing loop, but "break lbl" exits out of the first enclosing loop
  that carries the label "lbl".  Similarly for "continue".
  Give the transition rules for "break lbl" and "continue lbl". *)

(** ** Relating the continuation semantics with the other semantics *)

(** As in section 2, we show that termination according to the continuation semantics
  (predicate [kterminates]) is equivalent to big-step evaluation.
  The first implication, from big-step evaluation to termination, is a
  straightforward induction on the structure of the big-step
  evaluation derivation. *)

  big-step evaluation of [(c1, k1, st1)].  However, we now need to define
  big-step evaluation of a pair [(c, k)] of a subcommand and a continuation.
