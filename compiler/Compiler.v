(** This chapter defines a compiler from the Imp language to a virtual machine
  (a small subset of the Java Virtual Machine) and proves that this
  compiler preserves the semantics of the source programs. *)

(** * 1. The virtual machine. *)

(** The machine operates on a code [c] (a fixed list of instructions)
  and three variable components:
- a program counter, denoting a position in [c]
- a state assigning integer values to variables
- an evaluation stack, containing integers.
*)

(** The instruction set of the machine. *)

Inductive instruction: Type :=
  | Iconst(n: nat)                 (**r push integer [n] on stack *)
  | Ivar(x: id)                    (**r push the value of variable [x] *)
  | Isetvar(x: id)                 (**r pop an integer, assign it to variable [x] *)
  | Iadd                           (**r pop [n2], pop [n1], push back [n1+n2] *)
  | Isub                           (**r pop [n2], pop [n1], push back [n1-n2] *)
  | Imul                           (**r pop [n2], pop [n1], push back [n1*n2] *)
  | Ibranch_forward(ofs: nat)      (**r skip [ofs] instructions forward *)
  | Ibranch_backward(ofs: nat)     (**r skip [ofs] instructions backward *)
  | Ibeq(ofs: nat)                 (**r pop [n2], pop [n1], skip [ofs] forward if [n1=n2] *)
  | Ibne(ofs: nat)                 (**r pop [n2], pop [n1], skip [ofs] forward if [n1<>n2] *)

  | Ibgt(ofs: nat)                 (**r pop [n2], pop [n1], skip [ofs] forward if [n1>n2] *)
  | Ihalt.                         (**r terminate execution successfully *)

Definition code := list instruction.

(** [code_at C pc = Some i] if [i] is the instruction at position [pc]
  in the list of instructions [C]. *)

  | i :: C', S pc' => code_at C' pc'
  end.

Definition stack := list nat.

(** The semantics of the virtual machine is given in small-step style,
  as a transition relation between machine configuration: triples
  (program counter, evaluation stack, variable state).
  The transition relation is parameterized by the code [c].
  There is one transition rule for each kind of instruction,
  except [Ihalt], which has no transition. *)

Definition configuration := (nat * stack * state)%type.

Inductive transition (C: code): configuration -> configuration -> Prop :=

      code_at C pc = Some(Iconst n) ->
      transition C (pc, stk, s) (pc + 1, n :: stk, s)

      transition C (pc, n2 :: n1 :: stk, s) (pc', stk, s).

(** As usual with small-step semantics, we form sequences of machine transitions
  to define the behavior of a code.  We always start with [pc = 0]
  and an empty evaluation stack.  We stop successfully if [pc] points
  to an [Ihalt] instruction and the evaluation stack is empty.

  If [R] is a binary relation, [star R] is its reflexive transitive closure.
  (See file [Sequences] for the definition.)  [star (transition C)]
  therefore represents a sequence of  zero, one or several machine transitions.
*)

Definition mach_terminates (C: code) (s_init s_fin: state) :=
  exists pc,
  code_at C pc = Some Ihalt /\
  star (transition C) (0, nil, s_init) (pc, nil, s_fin).

(** Likewise, [infseq R] represents an infinite sequence of [R] transitions.
  (Also defined in file [Sequences].) *)

Definition mach_diverges (C: code) (s_init: state) :=
  infseq (transition C) (0, nil, s_init).

(** A third case can occur: after a finite number of transitions,
  the machine hits a configuration where it cannot make any transition,
  and this state is not a final configuration ([Ihalt] instruction and empty stack).
  In this case, we say that the machine "goes wrong", which is
  a politically-correct way of saying that our program just crashed. *)

Definition mach_goes_wrong (C: code) (s_init: state) :=
  exists pc, exists stk, exists s_fin,
  star (transition C) (0, nil, s_init) (pc, stk, s_fin)
  /\ irred (transition C) (pc, stk, s_fin)
  /\ (code_at C pc <> Some Ihalt \/ stk <> nil).

(** An important property of the virtual machine is that it is deterministic:
  from a given configuration, it can transition to at most one other configuration. *)

Lemma machine_deterministic:
  forall C config config1 config2,
  transition C config config1 -> transition C config config2 -> config1 = config2.
Proof.

  destruct (beq_nat n1 n2); congruence.
  destruct (beq_nat n1 n2); congruence.
  destruct (leb n1 n2); congruence.
  destruct (leb n1 n2); congruence.
Qed.

(** As a consequence of this determinism, it follows that
  the final state of a terminating program is unique,
  and that a program cannot both terminate and diverge,
  or terminate and go wrong, or diverge and go wrong.
  These results follow from the generic determinism properties
  found at the end of module [Sequence]. *)

(** *** Exercise (2 stars, recommended). *)
(** To quickly see how a machine program executes, it is convenient
  to redefine the semantics of the machine as an executable function
  instead of inductively-defined relations.  This is similar to the
  [ceval_step] function from the [Imp] chapter of Software Foundations,
  which provides an executable interpreter for the Imp language.

  To ensure termination of the machine interpreter, we need to bound
  the number of instructions it can execute.  The result of the
  machine interpreter, therefore, is of the following type:
*)

Inductive machine_result : Type :=
  | Timeout : machine_result              (**r the interpreter ran out of fuel *)
  | GoesWrong : machine_result            (**r the machine goes wrong on an impossible case *)
  | Terminates : state -> machine_result. (**r the machine successfully stops with the given state *)

(** Please fill in the blanks in the following definition for a machine interpreter: *)

Fixpoint mach_interp (C: code) (fuel: nat)
                     (pc: nat) (stk: stack) (st: state) : machine_result :=
  match fuel with
  | O => Timeout
  | S fuel' =>
      match code_at C pc, stk with
      | Some Ihalt, nil => Terminates st
      | Some (Iconst n), stk => mach_interp C fuel' (pc + 1) (n :: stk) st
      (* FILL IN HERE *)
      | _, _ => GoesWrong
      end
  end.

(** * 2. The compilation scheme *)

(** The code for an arithmetic expression [a]
- executes in sequence (no branches)
- deposits the value of [a] at the top of the stack
- preserves the variable state.

This is the familiar translation to "reverse Polish notation".
*)

Fixpoint compile_aexp (a: aexp) : code :=
  match a with
  | ANum n => Iconst n :: nil
  | AId v => Ivar v :: nil
  | APlus a1 a2 => compile_aexp a1 ++ compile_aexp a2 ++ Iadd :: nil
  | AMinus a1 a2 => compile_aexp a1 ++ compile_aexp a2 ++ Isub :: nil
  | AMult a1 a2 => compile_aexp a1 ++ compile_aexp a2 ++ Imul :: nil
  end.

(** Some examples. *)

Notation vx := (Id "X").
Notation vy := (Id "Y").

Compute (compile_aexp (APlus (AId vx) (ANum 1))).

(** Result is: [ [Ivar vx, Iconst 1, Iadd] ] *)

Compute (compile_aexp (AMult (AId vy) (APlus (AId vx) (ANum 1)))).

(** Result is: [ [Ivar vy, Ivar vx, Iconst 1, Iadd, Imul] ] *)

(** The code [compile_bexp b cond ofs] for a boolean expression [b]
- skips forward the [ofs] following instructions if [b] evaluates to [cond] (a boolean)
- executes in sequence if [b] evaluates to the negation of [cond]
- leaves the stack and the variable state unchanged.

See slides for explanation of the mysterious branch offsets!
*)

Fixpoint compile_bexp (b: bexp) (cond: bool) (ofs: nat) : code :=
  match b with
  | BTrue =>
      if cond then Ibranch_forward ofs :: nil else nil
  | BFalse =>
      if cond then nil else Ibranch_forward ofs :: nil
  | BEq a1 a2 =>
      compile_aexp a1 ++ compile_aexp a2 ++
      (if cond then Ibeq ofs :: nil else Ibne ofs :: nil)
  | BLe a1 a2 =>
      compile_aexp a1 ++ compile_aexp a2 ++
      (if cond then Ible ofs :: nil else Ibgt ofs :: nil)
  | BNot b1 =>
      compile_bexp b1 (negb cond) ofs
  | BAnd b1 b2 =>
      let c2 := compile_bexp b2 cond ofs in
      let c1 := compile_bexp b1 false (if cond then length c2 else ofs + length c2) in
      c1 ++ c2
  end.

(** Examples. *)

Compute (compile_bexp (BEq (AId vx) (ANum 1)) true 42).

(** Result is: [ [Ivar vx, Iconst 1, Ibeq 42] ] *)

Compute (compile_bexp (BAnd (BLe (ANum 1) (AId vx)) (BLe (AId vx) (ANum 10))) false 42).

(** Result is: [ [Iconst 1, Ivar vx, Ibgt 45, Ivar vx, Iconst 10, Ibgt 42] ] *)

Compute (compile_bexp (BNot (BAnd BTrue BFalse)) true 42).

(** Result is: [ [Ibranch_forward 42] ] *)

(** The code for a command [c]
- updates the variable state as prescribed by [c]
- preserves the stack
- finishes on the next instruction immediately following the generated code.

Again, see slides for explanations of the generated branch offsets.

Fixpoint compile_com (c: com) : code :=

  end.

(** The code for a program [p] (a command) is similar, but terminates
  cleanly on an [Ihalt] instruction. *)

Definition compile_program (p: com) : code :=
  compile_com p ++ Ihalt :: nil.

(** Examples of compilation: *)

Compute (compile_program (vx ::= APlus (AId vx) (ANum 1))).

(** Result is: [ [Ivar vx, Iconst 1, Iadd, Isetvar vx, Ihalt] ] *)

Compute (compile_program (WHILE BTrue DO SKIP END)).

(** Result is: [ [Ibranch_backward 1, Ihalt] ].  That's a tight loop indeed! *)

Compute (compile_program (IFB BEq (AId vx) (ANum 1) THEN vx ::= ANum 0 ELSE SKIP FI)).

(** Result is: [ [Ivar vx, Iconst 1, Ibne 3, Iconst 0, Isetvar vx, Ibranch_forward 0, Ihalt] ] *)

(** *** Exercise (1 star, recommended) *)
(** The last example shows a slight inefficiency in the code generated for
  [IFB ... THEN ... ELSE SKIP FI].  How would you change [compile_com]
  to generate better code?  Hint: ponder the following function. *)

(** ** Auxiliary results about code sequences. *)

(** To reason about the execution of compiled code, we need to consider
  code sequences [C2] that are at position [pc] in a bigger code

  [codeseq_at C pc C2] does just this. *)

(** *** Exercise (2 stars, recommended) *)

  [smart_Ibranch_forward] to avoid generating useless "branch forward"
  instructions when compiling [IFB ... THEN ... ELSE SKIP FI] commands.
  Once you have modified [compile_com] to use [smart_Ibranch_forward],
  adapt the proof of [compile_com_correct_terminating] accordingly.
  The following lemma will come handy: *)

Proof.
  unfold smart_Ibranch_forward; intros.
  (* FILL IN HERE *)
Admitted.

(** *** Exercise (3 stars, optional) *)
(** The manufacturer of our virtual machine offers a cheaper variant
  that lacks the [Ibge] and [Ibgt] conditional branches.  The only
  conditional branches available are [Ibeq] (branch if equal) and
  [Ibne] (branch if different).  Modify the definition of [compile_bexp] and
  its correctness proof to target this cheaper virtual machine.
  Hint: study Coq's definition of subtraction between natural numbers
  (do [Print Nat.sub]). *)

(** ** Correctness of generated code for commands: general case. *)

(** We would like to strengthen the correctness result above so that it
  is not restricted to terminating source programs, but also applies to
  source program that diverge.  To this end, we abandon the big-step
  semantics for commands and switch to the small-step semantics with continuations.
  We then show a simulation theorem, establishing that every transition
  of the small-step semantics in the source program is simulated (in a sense
  to be made precise below) by zero, one or several transitions of the
  machine executing the compiled code for the source program. *)

(** Our first task is to relate configurations [(c, k, st)] of the small-step
  semantics with configurations [(C, pc, stk, st)] of the machine.
  We already know how to relate a command [c] with the machine code,
  using the [codeseq_at] predicate.  What needs to be defined is a relation
  between the continuation [k] and the machine code.

  Intuitively, when the machine finishes executing the generated code for
  command [c], that is, when it reaches the program point
  [pc + length(compile_com c)], the machine should continue by executing
  instructions that perform the pending computations described by
  continuation [k], then reach an [Ihalt] instruction to stop cleanly.

  We formalize this intution by the following inductive predicate
  [compile_cont C k pc], which states that, starting at program point [pc],
  there are instructions that perform the computations described in [k]
  and reach an [Ihalt] instruction. *)

Inductive compile_cont (C: code): cont -> nat -> Prop :=
  | ccont_stop: forall pc,
      code_at C pc = Some Ihalt ->
      compile_cont C Kstop pc
  | ccont_seq: forall c k pc pc',
      codeseq_at C pc (compile_com c) ->
      pc' = pc + length (compile_com c) ->
      compile_cont C k pc' ->
      compile_cont C (Kseq c k) pc
  | ccont_while: forall b c k pc ofs pc' pc'',
      code_at C pc = Some(Ibranch_backward ofs) ->
      pc' = pc + 1 - ofs ->
      codeseq_at C pc' (compile_com (WHILE b DO c END)) ->
      pc'' = pc' + length (compile_com (WHILE b DO c END)) ->
      compile_cont C k pc'' ->
      compile_cont C (Kwhile b c k) pc
  | ccont_branch: forall ofs k pc pc',
      code_at C pc = Some(Ibranch_forward ofs) ->
      pc' = pc + 1 + ofs ->
      compile_cont C k pc' ->
      compile_cont C k pc.

(** Then, a configuration [(c,k,st)] of the small-step semantics matches
  a configuration [(C, pc, stk, st')] of the machine if the following conditions hold:
- The memory states are identical: [st' = st].
- The machine stack is empty: [stk = nil].
- The machine code at point [pc] is the compiled code for [c]:
  [codeseq_at C pc (compile_com c)].
- The machine code at point [pc + length (compile_com c)] matches continuation
  [k], in the sense of [compile_cont] above.
*)

Inductive match_config (C: code): com * cont * state -> configuration -> Prop :=
  | match_config_intro: forall c k st pc,
      codeseq_at C pc (compile_com c) ->
      compile_cont C k (pc + length (compile_com c)) ->
      match_config C (c, k, st) (pc, nil, st).

(** We are now ready to prove the expected simulation property.  Our first
  attempt is to show a diagram of the following form:
<<
                      match_config
     c / k / st  ----------------------- machstate
       |                                   |
       |                                   | *
       |                                   |
       v                                   v
    c' / k' / st' ----------------------- machstate'
                      match_config
>>
Hypotheses:
- Left: one transition in the small-step continuation semantics for Imp.
- Top: the [match_config] invariant.

Conclusions:
- Bottom: the [match_config] invariant, which must be preserved.
- Right: zero, one or several transitions of the virtual machine.

Why "zero, one, or several"?  Some transitions of the Imp semantics involve
the evaluation of a complex expression, which requires several machine instructions
to be executed.  However, other transitions of the Imp semantics, such as
the [KS_Seq] and [KS_SkipSeq] rules, just change the focus on a sub-command,
but the machine need not execute any instruction to reflect this change of focus.
*)

Lemma simulation_step_first_attempt:
  forall C impstate1 impstate2 machstate1,
  kstep impstate1 impstate2 ->
  match_config C impstate1 machstate1 ->
  exists machstate2,
      star (transition C) machstate1 machstate2
   /\ match_config C impstate2 machstate2.
Proof.
Abort.

(** This simulation lemma is true and can be proved, but it is too weak to
  imply the preservation of diverging behaviors: we have an issue with
  "infinite stuttering".  Imagine a situation where the source program
  takes infinitely many transitions, but every such transition is matched
  by zero transitions of the virtual machine.  In this case, the source
  program diverges, but the machine code can do anything: it can diverge,
  as expected, but it can also terminate cleanly or go wrong.
  The simulation lemma above is too weak to rule out the last two cases!

  We therefore need a stronger simulation result that rules out stuttering.
  To this end, we are going to require that if a source transition is
  matched by zero machine transition, some nonnegative measure of the source
  configuration must strictly decrease.  This ensures that only a finite
  number of stuttering steps can be taken before the machine actually does
  a transition.  Here is the revised simulation diagram:

<<
                      match_config
     c / k / st  ----------------------- machconfig
       |                                   |
       |                                   | + or ( * and |c',k'| < |c,k} )
       |                                   |
       v                                   v
    c' / k' / st' ----------------------- machconfig'
                      match_config
>>
Note the stronger conclusion on the right:
- either the virtual machine does one or several transitions
- or it does zero, one or several transitions, but the size of the [c,k]
  pair decreases strictly.

It would be equivalent to state:
- either the virtual machine does one or several transitions
- or it does zero transitions, but the size of the [c,k] pair decreases strictly.

However, the formulation above, with the "star" case, is often more convenient.
*)

(** Finding an appropriate "anti-stuttering" measure is a bit of a black art.
After trial and error, we find that the following measure works.  It is
the sum of the sizes of the command [c] under focus and all the commands
appearing in the continuation [k]. *)

Fixpoint com_size (c: com) : nat :=
  match c with
  | SKIP => 1
  | x ::= a => 1
  | (c1 ;; c2) => com_size c1 + com_size c2 + 1
  | IFB b THEN ifso ELSE ifnot FI => com_size ifso + com_size ifnot + 1
  | WHILE b DO c1 END => com_size c1 + 1
  end.

(** Our compiler for arithmetic expressions implements a left-to-right
  evaluation order: in [a1 + a2], [a1] is evaluated first, and its value
  left on the stack; then [a2] is evaluated; then an [Iadd] instruction
  is performed.  For commutative operators like [+] and [*], we
  could just as well evaluate [a2] first, then [a1], then combine
  their results.

  This can help producing more efficient code in terms of how much
  stack space is required by the evaluation.  Consider the expression
  [1 + (2 + (3 + ... (N-1 + N)))].  With left-to-right evaluation,
  it uses [N+1] stack entries.  With right-to-left evaluation,
  it uses only 2 stack entries.

  In this exercise, we explore the effect of different evaluation orders
  on stack usage.  Let us first parameterize [compile_aexp] with
  a heuristic function [ord] that, given the two arguments of a [+]
  or [*] operator, decides whether to evaluate them left-to-right

(** This definition is a variation on the Strahler numbering of a tree.

  evaluate [a1] then [a2], we will need at least [stack_needs a1]
  space for evaluating [a1], then [stack_needs a2 + 1] for [a2]:
  plus one, because during the evaluation of [a2], the value of [a1]
  sits in the stack.  So, our space usage is the max of these two
  quantities.  But we can also choose the other evaluation order,
  so our space usage is the min of the two max corresponding to the
  two possible evaluation orders. *)

(** To show that [stack_needs] is the minimal stack size required,

(** Useful tip: the tactic [zify; omega] works very well to prove
    arithmetic properties involving min and max operators. *)

(** An optimal strategy (with respect to stack usage) is to always
  compute the biggest subexpression first: *)

Definition optimal_ord (a1 a2: aexp) :=
  if leb (stack_needs a2) (stack_needs a1) then LtoR else RtoL.

Definition compile_aexp_optimal (a: aexp) : code :=
  compile_aexp_gen optimal_ord a.

(** The intuition is simple: if one of the arguments, say [a1], has
  stack needs strictly less than the other, say [a2], evaluating [a1]
  after [a2], with [a2]'s value as additional entry on the stack,
  will use no more stack space than evaluating [a2].  So, evaluating
  [a1 + a2] can be done with no extra space than evaluating just [a2].
  This would not be the case if we started with [a1], then evaluated [a2]:
  in this case, one more stack slot would be needed.

  If both arguments have the same stack needs, the two evaluation
  orders use exactly the same amount of space, so it does not matter
  which one we choose. *)

(** We can show the optimality of the strategy by observing that
  its stack usage is the minimum predicted by [stack_needs]. *)

(** So far, we've reasoned informally on the stack usage of a particular
  evaluation strategy.  Now, let us formally connect this reasoning with the

  if the stack size goes over a given maximum [maxstack]. *)

Proof.
  (* Have fun! *)
Admitted.

(** The [True] above is to be replaced by some informative relation between
  the final stack [stk] and the final store [st]. *)

(** Some hints to get you started.  Clearly, we need to use a portion of
  the stack to hold the current values for the program variables.  It may
  seem impossible to represent a store (a function from identifiers to values,
  giving gives values to infinitely many variables) as a stack (a finite
  list of values).  However, only the variables that are ever assigned to
  within the program need to be associated with a stack slot: all
  other variables keep their initial value of 0 throughout the program
  execution. *)

(**  Hence, the first order of business is to construct a list of
  variables that are ever assigned in the program, and, from this
  list, to assign a position in the stack for every such variable.
  For example, if the list of assigned variables is [["x";"y";"z"]]
  we could say that the value of ["x"] is at the top of the stack,
  the value of ["y"] one slot below, and that of ["z"] two slots below.
  Those offsets need adjusting during the evaluation of expressions,
  because intermediate results are pushed on the stack on top of the
  values of variables. *)

(**  Using this information, the compilation of an expression [AId id] is
  either [Iconst 0] if the variable is not assigned in the program,
  or, [Iget N] otherwise, for a stack distance [N] that reflects the
  stack position of variable [id]. *)

(** To state and prove semantic preservation for the compilation functions,
  you will need a predicate [agree st stk] that relates an IMP store [st]
  with a machine stack [stk].  Typically, it will say that
- [st x = 0] for all non-assigned variables [x]
- [get_nth_slot stk N = Some (st x)] if [N] is the stack offset for variable [x]

  The predicate [agree st stk] acts both as a pre- and a post-condition, e.g.
