(** ** QuickChick and Vellvm **************************************************)
(** One may expect a compiler for a language as simple as IMP to be relatively
    straightforward, and a proof of its correctness to be correspondingly
    so. However, LLVM is a full-featured IR, and a faithful formalization
    is necessarily complex and large. When the compiler is under development,
    even stating the correctness of the compiler can be difficult, much
    less prove it.

    But if we have interpreters for both the source and target, testing the
    compiler is a much simpler affair. Moreover, the simplicity of the source
    language, i.e. Imp. means that it is really easy to test! *)

(** This lecture shows how QuickChick can be used to test the compiler. For
    simplicity, the target language is the simplified SSA language Vminus, and
    we use a variant of Imp whose names are just memory addresses which can be
    interpreted in the memory of Vminus states. Imp states and Vminus memory
    are hence essentially the same, and this makes it easy to state correct
    compilation: after running the source program and its compilation,
    every Imp variable/address is mapped to the same nat by both the Imp state
    and Vminus memory.

    A Vminus state consists of a memory (mapping addresses to nat), a program
    counter, an environment mapping locals to nat, a "previous" program
    counter, and a "previous" environment. The latter two are needed for
    executing phi nodes. A configuration consists of a Vminus state and a CFG,
    which "holds" Vminus instructions organized in basic blocks.
*)

(** Here's a look at what we mean.

Theorem compile_program_correct_terminating:
  forall c m m' g le lr,
  (g, le, lr) = compile c ->
  imp_terminates c m m' ->
  vminus_terminates g m m'.

  This is one of the top-level correctness theorems for the compiler: for any
  initial memory m, if the source program c terminates with memory (Imp state)
  m', running the compilation result g (a control flow graph holding the
  instructions) on the same initial memory m also results in termination, and
  with its final (Vminus) memory also being m. This is where the coincidence of
  Imp states and Vminus memory comes into play.

  Terminating Imp programs are those that are evaluated to just SKIP, as the
  following definition shows.

  Definition imp_terminates (c: com) (m m':mem) : Prop :=
    star Imp.step (c, m) (SKIP, m').

  For Vminus programs on the other hand, running them on an initial memory m
  leads to termination with memory m' if execution reaches some uid x
  associated with a return terminator.

  Definition vminus_terminates (g:ListCFG.t) (m m':mem) : Prop :=
    exists x st',
      insns_at_pc g st'.(st_pc) [(x, cmd_tmn tmn_ret)] /\
      st'.(st_mem) = m' /\
      star (step g) (init_state g m) st'.

  The variables x and st' here are determined by "running"/evaluation, as
  indicated by "star (step g) (init_state g m) st'". So checking for their
  existence is really verifying that an evaluation function reaches st'
  satisfying the constraints.
 *)

(** Let us try to write a Checker for the theorem. Looking at the universals,
    it would appear that we need generators for Imp commands (c), Imp
    states/memories (m, m'), control flow graphs (g) and labels (le, lr).
    However, note that g, le, and lr are computed by "compile c", so we
    don't actually need generators for them. Moreover, we do not want just any
    c and m', but only terminating Imp programs, and m' is obtained by running
    an Imp evaluator on m. Hence for generation, we only need:
    - A generator for mem.
    - A generator for Imp programs that are guaranteed to terminate.
    And for checking, we would need:
    - An evaluator for Imp that reaches termination, i.e. SKIP.
    - An evaluator for Vminus that reaches termination, i.e. a return
      terminator.
    - We also need to check that the final state st' that the Vminus evaluator
      reaches has the desired memory.
*)

(** Let us first define an evaluator for Vminus. The evaluator stops when
    a return terminator is reached. *)

(** For the next part, let us go into the sort of lemmas that would be needed
    to prove the top-level correctness theorems like the one above. Here's one.

Lemma comp_aexp_correct : forall (a:aexp),
    comp_correct (comp_aexp a) (aeval a).

Definition comp_correct (comp : ectmon (val * list insn))
           (eval : mem -> nat) : Prop :=
  forall (cs cs': list uid) (g: ListCFG.t) (st: V.Opsem.state)
    (is k: list insn) (v: val),
    (cs', (v, is)) = comp cs ->
    insns_at_pc g (st_pc st) (is ++ k) ->
    exists st',
      st_mem st' = st_mem st /\
      insns_at_pc g (st_pc st') k /\
      star (Opsem.step g) st st' /\
      ids_preserved cs st st' /\
      good_return cs' v /\
      ctx_incr cs cs' /\
      eval_val (st_loc st') v = Some (eval (st_mem st)).
*)

(** That is, compiling Imp aexp is correct if:
    - for any compilation run on an initial list of uids,
    - wherever we place the compilation result "is" in the CFG, as long
      as the pc is pointed to it, (insns_at_pc g (st_pc) (is ++ k)),
    - we can run to the end of compilation (insns_at_pc g (st_pc st') k),
    - and in this state st', the memory is the same as above; but evaluating
      the result of the expression in this state (eval_val (st_loc st') v)
      is exactly the same as evaluating it according to the Imp state
      (eval (st_mem st)).
    - This last fact may not be obvious from the body of comp_correct. But note
      comp_aexp_correct; the evaluation function passed to it is Imp's aeval,
      and this is where the coincidence of Imp states and Vminus memory comes
      into play.
    There is a bunch of other things that we need here, so as to prove correct
    compilation for com. But the above description is the crux.
*)

(** Looking at comp_correct, it is clear that we need to generate more than
    just the things we had before. In particular, it would seem that we need
    generators for the following:
    - uid
    - CFG
    - Vminus states
    - Vminus instructions
    - values
    But note again that the only value v (with cs', is) is computed by comp
    rather than generated, so we don't actually need a generator for value.
    Moreover, the CFG g should not be generated randomly the same way we do
    others, because it has to satisfy insns_at_pc; it is unlikely for just
    "any" CFG to satisfy this precondition of the lemma. *)

(** With these out of the way, we can now address the remaining gaps. In its
    current form, comp_correct is inefficient and challenging for testing.
    Firstly, some of the quantities are computed by a function, so it is
    unnecessary to generate them in the first place, although seemingly
    suggested by "forall". Secondly, the CFG g is not just any CFG, but one
    that satisfies insns_at_pc for the compilation result - random generation
    in the usual way is very, very unlikely to meet this condition, so most
    checks would end up being vacuously true. Thirdly, a Checker for the
    the existence of st' really needs to compute it, and this is not part of
    the lemma itself.

    Hence the first order of affairs is to massage the lemma into a
    Checker-friendly version.
 *)

(** Firstly, let us drop the unnecessary variables, and note the generation
    of state.

    Definition comp_correct (comp : ectmon (val * list insn))
                            (eval : mem -> nat) : Prop :=
      forall (cs: list uid) (g: ListCFG.t) (k: list insn),
      forall (mem_dom: list Atom.t) (loc_dom: list Atom.t) (st: state),

      let (cs', (v, is)) := comp cs in

      insns_at_pc g (st_pc st) (is ++ k) ->
      exists st',
        st_mem st' = st_mem st /\
        insns_at_pc g (st_pc st') k /\
        star (Opsem.step g) st st' /\
        ids_preserved cs st st' /\
        good_return cs' v /\
        ctx_incr cs cs' /\
        eval_val (st_loc st') v = Some (eval (st_mem st)).

    This is of course not accepted by Coq, but we will eventually get to a
    Checker.
 *)

(** Secondly, we need to write a custom generator that generates CFGs
    satisfying insns_at_pc. An easier option is to just construct a CFG that
    loads the instructions at a given pc.

    Let us call this wrap_code_in_cfg' pc is k, in correspondence with
    insns_at_pc g (st_pc st) (is ++ k).

    However, because pc may have a positive offset into the block, we should
    also fill the initial instructions with some dummy instructions (that won't
    be executed). So make wrap_code_in_cfg' do this.
*)

(* Returns a CFG with a single block containing instrs ++ instrs_after,
    and the pc in that block that begins at instrs_after *)
Definition wrap_code_in_cfg' (p: pc) (instrs instrs_after: list insn)
  : ListCFG.t :=
  (* FILL IN HERE *)
  let empty_cfg := [] in
  let '(lbl, offset) := p in
  let blocks :=
      ListCFG.update empty_cfg lbl
                     ((generate_dummy_insns offset)
                        ++ instrs ++ instrs_after) in
  (lbl, blocks).

(** The to-be-Checkable lemma is thus:

    Definition comp_correct (comp : ectmon (val * list insn))
                            (eval : mem -> nat) : Prop :=
      forall (cs: list uid) (k: list insn),
      forall (mem_dom: list Atom.t) (loc_dom: list Atom.t) (st: state),

      let (cs', (v, is)) := comp cs in
      let g := wrap_code_in_cfg (st_pc st) is k in

      exists st',
        st_mem st' = st_mem st /\
        insns_at_pc g (st_pc st') k /\
        star (Opsem.step g) st st' /\
        ids_preserved cs st st' /\
        good_return cs' v /\
        ctx_incr cs cs' /\
        eval_val (st_loc st') v = Some (eval (st_mem st)).
*)

(** Thirdly, if we have grasped the meaning of the lemma, we know that st'
    is given by executing the compilation result; this is the point of
    "loading" the compilation result at the current pc in g, and is of course
    also stated by "star (Opsem.step g) st st'". So we need an executable
    evaluator for Vminus. The state st' is obtained by running this evaluator
    until we reach (the start of) k.

    The simplest way of doing so is to stop at the program counter that begins
    k, and this is actually determined by the CFG that loaded (is ++ k).
*)

(** Exercise: Change wrap_code_in_cfg to return (g, pc), where the latter is
    the pc that begins k. *)

Definition wrap_code_in_cfg (p: pc) (instrs instrs_after: list insn)
  : ListCFG.t * pc :=
  (* FILL IN HERE *)
  let empty_cfg := [] in
  let '(lbl, offset) := p in
  let blocks :=
      ListCFG.update empty_cfg lbl
                     ((generate_dummy_insns offset)
                        ++ instrs ++ instrs_after) in
  ((lbl, blocks), (lbl, offset + List.length instrs)).

(** Now we need the evaluator itself, which we have defined for you. *)

Check V.Opsem.eval_until_pc.
Check V.Opsem.eval_step.

(** Now the lemma is:

    Definition comp_correct (comp : ectmon (val * list insn))
                            (eval : mem -> nat) : Prop :=
      forall (cs: list uid) (k: list insn),
      forall (mem_dom: list Atom.t) (loc_dom: list Atom.t) (st: state),

      let (cs', (v, is)) := comp cs in
      let (g, endpoint) := wrap_code_in_cfg (st_pc st) is k in

      match V.Opsem.eval_until_pc g st cutpoint 1000 with
      | inl err => false (* either out of fuel or no st' *)
      | inr st' =>
        st_mem st' = st_mem st /\
        insns_at_pc g (st_pc st') k /\
        star (Opsem.step g) st st' /\
        ids_preserved cs st st' /\
        good_return cs' v /\
        ctx_incr cs cs' /\
        eval_val (st_loc st') v = Some (eval (st_mem st))
      end.
 *)

(** And with this, the major obstacles are out of the way, and we only have
    to write a Checker for the big conjunction. Because the conjunction is
    huge, it is easier to write a Checker for each conjunct. That is, we would
    like to have:
    - A Checker that checks that two memories are the same. This has already
      been done.
    - A Checker that checks for insns_at_pc g.
    - A Checker for ids_preserved.
    - A Checker for good_return.
    - A Checker for ctxt_incr.
    - A Checker that checks for equality between the two ways of evaluation.
    Note that "star (Opsem.step g) st st'" doesn't need checking, because it is
    implicit in eval_until_pc. With respect to correctness of aexp compilation
    itself, the last is most relevant.

    To give a headstart, most of these are defined below.
