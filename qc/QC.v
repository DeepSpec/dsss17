(** * Generators *)

(** The heart of property-based random testing is random generation of
    inputs.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The [G] Monad *)

(** In QuickChick, a generator for elements of some type [A] belongs
    to the type [G A].  Intuitively, this type describes functions
    that take a random seed to an element of [A], plus a new random
    seed to be used for generating further random values.  (We will
    see below that [G] is actually a bit richer than this, but this
    intuition will do for now.)

    QuickChick provides a number of primitives for building
    generators.  First, [returnGen] takes a constant value and yields
    a generator that always returns this value. *)

Check returnGen.
(**
     ===>
       returnGen : ?A -> G ?A
*)

(** We can see how it behaves by using the [Sample] command: *)

Sample (returnGen 42).
(**
     ===>
         [42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42]
*)

(** Next, given a random generator for [A] and a _function_ [f] taking
    an element of [A] and yielding a random generator for [B], we can
    plumb the two together into a generator for [B] that works by
    internally generating a random [A] and applying [f] to it. *)

Check bindGen.
(**
     ===>
        bindGen : G ?A -> (?A -> G ?B) -> G ?B
*)

(** With these two primitives in hand, we can make [G] an instance of
    the [Monad] typeclass.  (This [Instance] should really be defined
    within QuickChick itself, but it are not at the moment.) *)

Instance gMonad : `{Monad G} | 3 :=
  {
    ret := @returnGen;
    bind := @bindGen
  }.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Primitive generators *)

(** Next, QuickChick provides primitive generators for booleans,
    natural numbers and integers. They are accessed via the [choose]
    combinator. *)

Print ChoosableFromInterval.

Check @choose.
(**
     ===>
        @choose
           : forall A : Type, ChoosableFromInterval A -> A * A -> G A
*)

(** The [ChoosableFromInterval] typeclass describes primitive types
    [A], like natural numbers and integers ([Z]), for which it makes
    sense to randomly generate elements from a given interval. *)

Sample (choose (0,10)).
(**
     ===>
       [ 1, 2, 1, 9, 8, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 4, 10, 4, 6 ]
*)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, optional (cfi)  *)
(** Print out the definition of [ChoosableFromInterval].  Can you
    understand what it means?  [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Lists *)

(** Since they are a very commonly used compound datatype, lists have
    special combinators in QuickChick: [listOf] and [vectorOf]. *)

(** The [listOf] combinator takes as input a generator for elements of
    type [A] and returns a generator for lists of [A]s. *)

Check listOf.
(**
     ===>
      listOf : G ?A -> G (list ?A)
*)

Sample (listOf (choose (0,4))).
(**
     ===>
      [ [ 0, 3, 2, 0 ],
        [ 1, 3, 4, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 1 ],
        [ 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1 ],
        [ 0 ],
        [ 4, 2, 3 ],
        [ 3, 3, 4, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1 ],
        [ 0, 4 ],
        [  ],
        [ 1, 0, 1, 3, 1 ],
        [ 0, 0 ],
        [ 1, 4 ],
        [ 4, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0 ],
        [ 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 4 ],
        [ 2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 3 ],
        [ 4, 3, 3, 0, 1 ],
        [ 3, 3, 3 ],
        [ 3, 2, 4 ],
        [ 1, 2 ],
        [  ],
        [  ] ]
*)

(** The second combinator, [vectorOf], receives an additional numeric
    argument [n], the length of the list to be generated. *)

Check vectorOf.
(**
     ===>
      vectorOf : nat -> G ?A -> G (list ?A)
*)

Sample (vectorOf 3 (choose (0,4))).
(**
     ===>
      [ [0, 1, 4],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [3, 3, 3],
        [0, 2, 1],
        [1, 3, 2],
        [3, 3, 0],
        [3, 0, 4],
        [2, 3, 3],
        [3, 2, 4],
        [1, 2, 3],
        [2, 0, 4]  ]
*)

(** This raises a question.  It's clear how [vectorOf] decides how big
    to make its lists (we tell it!), but how does [listOf] do it?  The
    answer is hidden inside [G].

    In addition to handling random-seed plumbing, the [G] monad also
    maintains a "current maximum size" (in the style of a "reader
    monad", if you like that terminology): a natural number [n] that
    serves as the upper bound on the depth of generated objects.  When
    it is searching for counterexamples, QuickChick progressively
    tries larger and larger values for [n], in order to explore larger
    and deeper part of the search space.

    Each generator can choose to interpret the size bound however it
    wants, and there is no enforced guarantee that generators pay any
    attention to it at all; however, it is good practice to respect
    this bound when programming new generators. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Custom Generators *)

(** Naturally, we often need generators involving user-defined
    datatypes.  Here's a simple one to play with: *)

Inductive color := Red | Green | Blue | Yellow.

(** In order for commands like [Sample] to display colors, we should
    make [color] an instance of the [Show] typeclass: *)

Require Import String. Open Scope string.
Instance show_color : Show color :=
  {| show c :=
       match c with
         | Red    => "Red"
         | Green  => "Green"
         | Blue   => "Blue"
         | Yellow => "Yellow"
       end
  |}.

(** Now, to generate a random color, we just need to pick one of the
    constructors [Red], [Green], [Blue], or [Yellow]. This is done
    using [elements]. *)

Check elements.
(**
     ===>
      elements : ?A -> list ?A -> G ?A
*)

Definition genColor' : G color :=
  elements Red [ Red ; Green ; Blue ; Yellow ].

Sample genColor'.
(**
     ===>
     [Red, Green, Blue, Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red]
*)

(** The first argument to [elements] serves as a default result.  If
    its list argument is not empty, [elements] returns a generator
    that always picks an element of that list; otherwise the generator
    always returns the default object.  This makes Coq's totality
    checker happy, but makes [elements] a little awkward to use, since
    typically its second argument will be a non-empty constant list.
    To make this common case smoother, QuickChick provides convenient
    notations that automatically extract the default. *)
(**
     " 'elems' [ x ] " := elements x (cons x nil)
     " 'elems' [ x ; y ] " := elements x (cons x (cons y nil))
     " 'elems' [ x ; y ; .. ; z ] " := elements x
     " 'elems' ( x ;; l ) " := elements x (cons x l)
*)

(** Armed with [elems], we can write a [color] generator the way we'd
    hope. *)

Definition genColor : G color :=
  elems [ Red ; Green ; Blue ; Yellow ].

Sample genColor.
(**
      ===>
       [Red, Green, Blue, Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red]
*)

(** For more complicated ADTs, QuickChick provides more combinators.
    We will showcase these using everyone's favorite datatype: trees!

    Our trees are standard polymorphic binary trees; either [Leaf]s or
    [Node]s containing some payload of type [A] and two subtrees. *)

Inductive Tree A :=
| Leaf : Tree A
| Node : A -> Tree A -> Tree A -> Tree A.

Arguments Leaf {A}.
Arguments Node {A} _ _ _.

(** Before getting to generators for trees, we again give a
    straightforward [Show] instance.  (The need for a local [let fix]
    declaration stems from the fact that Coq's typeclasses (unlike
    Haskell's) are not automatically recursive.  We could
    alternatively define [aux] with a separate top-level
    [Fixpoint].) *)

Instance showTree {A} `{_ : Show A} : Show (Tree A) :=
  {| show :=
       let fix aux t :=
         match t with
           | Leaf => "Leaf"
           | Node x l r =>
               "Node (" ++ show x ++ ") (" ++ aux l ++ ") (" ++ aux r ++ ")"
         end
       in aux
  |}.

(** Now we come to the first _generator combinator_, called [oneof]. *)

Check oneof.
(**
      ===>
       oneof : G ?A -> list (G ?A) -> G ?A
*)

(** This combinator takes a default generator and a list of
    generators, and it picks one of the generators from the list
    uniformly at random (as long as the list is not empty, in which
    case it picks from the default generator).  As for [elements],
    QuickChick introduces a more convenient notation [oneOf] to hide
    this default element.

    At this point, Coq's termination checker is going to save us from
    shooting ourselves in the foot. The "obvious" first generator that
    one might write is the following function [genTree], which
    generates either a [Leaf] or else a [Node] whose subtrees are
    generated recursively (and whose payload is produced by a
    generator [g] for elements of type [A]).*)

(**

     Fixpoint genTree {A} (g : G A) : G (Tree A) :=
        oneOf [ ret Leaf ;;
                liftM3 Node g (genTree g) (genTree g) ].
*)

(** Of course, this fixpoint will not pass Coq's termination
    checker. Attempting to justify this fixpoint informally, one might
    first say that at some point the random generation will pick a
    [Leaf] so it will eventually terminate.  But the termination
    checker cannot understand this kind of probabilistic reasoning.
    Moreover, even informally, the reasoning is wrong: Every time we
    choose to generate a [Node], we create two separate branches that
    must both be terminated with leaves.  From this, it is not hard to
    show that the _expected_ size of the generated trees is actually
    infinite!

    The solution is to use the standard "fuel" idiom that all Coq
    users know.  We add an additional natural number [sz] as a
    parameter.  We decrease this size in each recursive call, and when
    it reaches [O], we always generate [Leaf].  Thus, the initial [sz]
    parameter serves as a bound on the depth of the tree. *)

Fixpoint genTreeSized {A} (sz : nat) (g : G A) : G (Tree A) :=
  match sz with
    | O => ret Leaf
    | S sz' => oneOf
                 [ ret Leaf ;
                   liftM3 Node g (genTreeSized sz' g) (genTreeSized sz' g)
                 ]
  end.

Sample (genTreeSized 3 (choose(0,3))).
(**
      ===>
       [ Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Node (3) (Node (0) (Leaf) (Leaf))
                  (Node (2) (Leaf) (Node (3) (Leaf) (Leaf))),
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Node (1) (Leaf) (Node (1) (Leaf) (Node (0) (Leaf) (Leaf))),
         Leaf,
         Node (3) (Leaf) (Leaf),
         Node (1) (Leaf) (Leaf),
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Node (0) (Leaf) (Node (0) (Leaf) (Node (2) (Leaf) (Leaf))),
         Node (0) (Node (2) (Node (3) (Leaf) (Leaf)) (Leaf)) (Leaf),
         Node (0) (Leaf) (Leaf),
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Leaf ]
*)

(** While this generator succeeds in avoiding nontermination, we can
    see just by observing the result of [Sample] that there is a
    problem: [genTreeSized] produces way too many [Leaf]s!  This is
    actually to be expected, since half the time we generate a [Leaf]
    right at the outset. We can obtain more interesting trees more
    often if we skew the distribution towards [Node]s using the most
    expressive QuickChick combinator, [frequency] and its associated
    default-lifting notation [freq]. *)

Check frequency.
(**
      ===>
       frequency : G ?A -> seq (nat * G ?A) -> G ?A
*)

(** The more convenient form, [freq], takes a list of generators, each
    tagged with a natural number that serves as the weight of that
    generator.  For example, in the following generator, a [Leaf] will
    be generated 1 / (sz + 1) of the time and a [Node] the remaining
    sz / (sz + 1) of the time.*)

Fixpoint genTreeSized' {A} (sz : nat) (g : G A) : G (Tree A) :=
  match sz with
    | O => ret Leaf
    | S sz' =>
        freq [ (1,  ret Leaf) ;
               (sz, liftM3 Node g (genTreeSized' sz' g)
                                  (genTreeSized' sz' g))
             ]
  end.

(** ** Checkers *)

(** To showcase how such a generator could be used in practice for
    finding counterexamples, suppose we define a function for
    "mirroring" a tree -- swapping its left and right subtrees
    recursively. *)

Fixpoint mirror {A : Type} (t : Tree A) : Tree A :=
  match t with
    | Leaf => Leaf
    | Node x l r => Node x (mirror r) (mirror l)
  end.

(** To formulate a property about [mirror], we also need a simple
    structural equality on trees: *)

Fixpoint eq_tree (t1 t2 : Tree nat) : bool :=
  match t1, t2 with
    | Leaf, Leaf => true
    | Node x1 l1 r1, Node x2 l2 r2 =>
      beq_nat x1 x2 && eq_tree l1 l2 && eq_tree r1 r2
    | _, _ => false
  end.

(** We expect that [mirror] should be "unipotent": mirroring a tree
    twice yields the original tree.  *)

Definition mirrorP (t : Tree nat) := eq_tree (mirror (mirror t)) t.

(** Now we want to use our generator to create a lot of random trees
    and, for each one, check whether [mirrorP] returns [true] or
    [false].  That is, we want to use [mirrorP] to build a _generator
    for test results_.

    Let's open a playground module so we can show simplified versions
    of the actual QUickChick definitions. *)

Module CheckerPlayground1.

(** First, we need a type of test results -- let's call it [Result].
    For the moment, think of [Result] as just an enumerated type with
    constructors [Success] and [Failure].  *)

Inductive Result := Success | Failure.

Instance showResult : Show Result :=
  {
    show r := match r with Success => "Success" | Failure => "Failure" end
  }.

(** Then we can define the type [Checker] to be [G Result]. *)

Definition Checker := G Result.

(** To check [mirrorP], we need a way to build a [Checker] out of a
    function from trees to booleans.  But let's start simpler and see
    how to build a checker out of a [bool]. *)

  }.

Instance checkableBool : Checkable bool :=

    checker b := if b then ret Success else ret Failure
  }.

(** Let's see what happens if we sample our favorite booleans.  (We
    need to exit the playground so that we can do [Sample], because
    [Sample] is implemented internally via extraction to OCaml, which

(** What we've done so far may look a a bit strange, since our
    checkers always generate constant results.  We'll make things more
    interesting in a bit, but first let's pause to define one more
    instance of [Checkable]. *)

Module CheckerPlayground2.
Export CheckerPlayground1.

(** A decidable [Prop] is not too different from a boolean, so we
    should be able to build a checker from that. *)

  }.

(** (The definition looks a bit strange since it doesn't use its
    argument [p].  The intuition is that all the information in [p] is
    already encoded in [P]!) *)

(** Now suppose we pose a couple of (decidable) conjectures: *)

Conjecture c1 : 0 = 42.
Conjecture c2 : 41 + 1 = 42.

End CheckerPlayground2.

(** The somewhat astononishing thing is that, even though these are
    _conjectures_ (we haven't proved them, so the "evidence" that Coq
    has for them internally is just an uninstantiated "evar"), but --
    because the [Checkable] instance for decidable properties does not
    look at its argument -- we can still build checkers from them and
    sample from these checkers! *)

(** Again, the intuition is that, although we didn't present proofs,
    Coq already "knows" either a proof or a disproof of each of these
    conjectures because they are decidable. *)

Module CheckerPlayground3.
Import CheckerPlayground2.

(** Now let's go back to [mirrorP].

    We have seen that the result of [mirrorP] is [Checkable].  What we
    need is a way of taking a function returning a checkable thing and
    making the function itself checkable.  We can easily do this, as
    long as the argument type of the function is something we know how
    to generate! *)

(** * Shrinking *)

(** Shrinking, also known as delta debugging, is a process that, given
    a counterexample to some property, searches (greedily) for smaller
    counterexamples.  Given a shrinking function [s] of type [A -> list
    A] and a counterexample [x] of type [A] that is known to falsify
    some property [p], QuickChick (lazily) tries [p] on all members of
    [s x] until it finds another counterexample; then it repeats this
    process.

    This greedy algorithm can only work if all elements of [s x] are
    strictly "smaller" that [x] for all [x]. Most of the time, a
    shrinking function for some type only returns elements that are
    "one step" smaller. For example, consider the default shrinking
    function for lists provided by QuickChick. *)

Print shrinkList.
(**
      ===>
       shrinkList =
         fix shrinkList (A : Type) (shr : A -> seq A) (l : seq A) {struct l} :
           seq (seq A) :=
           match l with
           | [::] => [::]

           end
              : forall A : Type, (A -> seq A) -> seq A -> seq (seq A)

(** An empty list can not be shrunk - there is no smaller list.  A
    cons cell can be shrunk in three ways: by returning the tail of
    the list, by shrinking the tail of the list and consing the head,
    or by shrinking the head and consing its tail. By induction, this
    process can generate all smaller lists.

    Writing a shrinking instance for trees is equally straightforward:
    we don't shrink [Leaf]s while for [Node]s we can return the left
    or right subtrees, shrink the payload or one of the subtrees.*)

(**  typeclass magic to hide forAll (requires introducing Gen and GenSized)
 *)
(** QuickChick, just like QuickCheck, provides an [Arbitrary]
    typeclass parameterized over some type [A] with two objects:
    [arbitrary] and [shrink].

    The [arbitrary] object is a generator for elements of type [A]. If
    we were to encode an [Arbitrary] instance for trees we would like
    to use [genTreeSized']; however that generator takes an additional
    size argument.  The [G] monad will provide that argument through
    the combinator [sized].*)

Check sized.
(**
      ===>
        sized : (nat -> G ?A) -> G ?A
*)

(** [sized] receives a function that given a number produces a
    generator, just like [genTreeSized'], and returns a generator that
    uses the size information inside the [G] monad.

    The [shrink] function is simply a shrinker like [shrinkTree]. *)

Instance genTree {A} `{Gen A} : GenSized (Tree A) :=
  {| arbitrarySized n := genTreeSized n arbitrary |}.

Instance shrTree {A} `{Shrink A} : Shrink (Tree A) :=
  {| shrink x := shrinkTree shrink x |}.

(** With this [Arbitrary] instance we can once again use the toplevel
    [QuickChick] command with just the property.  *)

(* QuickChick faultyMirrorP. *)

(** [QuickChick] internally calls the function [quickCheck] with type
    [forall prop. Checkable prop => prop -> Result]. But what _is_
    [Checkable]? It is easy to see how a boolean is [Checkable]; we
    can always tell if it is true or not and then return a [Result],
    [Success]/[Failure] as appropriate.

    To see how executable properties are [Checkable], consider a
    single argument function [p : A -> Bool] that returns a
    boolean. If we know that [A] has [Show] and [Arbitrary] instances,
    we can just call [forAllShrink] with [arbitrary] and
    [shrink]. Going a step further, the result type doesn't really
    need to be [Bool], it can be a [Checkable]! Thus, we can provide a
    [Checkable] instance for arbitrary functions.*)

    straightforward. After writing a couple of [Show] and [Arbitrary]
    instances, it can get tedious and boring. That is precisely why

    for _plain_ datatypes automatically. *)

(** * Collecting Statistics *)

(** Earlier in this tutorial we claimed that [genTreeSized] produced
    "too many" [Leaf]s. But how can we justify that? Just looking at
    the result of [Sample] gives us an idea that something is going
    wrong but just observing a handful of samples cannot realistically
    provide statistical guarantees. That is where [collect], another
    property combinator, comes in. In Haskell notation, [collect]
    would have the type [collect : Show A, Checkable prop => A -> prop
    -> prop]; it takes some value of type [A] that can be shown and a
    property, and returns the property itself. Whenever the resulting
    property is exercised, the [A] object is captured and statistics
    are collected.

    For example, consider a [size] function on [Tree]s.
