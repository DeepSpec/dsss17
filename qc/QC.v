(** * Generators *)

(** The heart of property-based random testing is random generation of
    inputs.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The [G] Monad *)

(** In QuickChick, a generator for elements of some type [A] belongs
    to the type [G A].  Intuitively, this type describes functions
    that take a random seed to an element of [A].  (We will see below
    that [G] is actually a bit richer, but this intuition will do for
    now.) *)

(** QuickChick provides a number of primitives for building
    generators.  First, [returnGen] takes a constant value and yields
    a generator that always returns this value. *)

Check returnGen.
(**  
     ===> 
       returnGen : ?A -> G ?A 
*)

(** We can see how it behaves by using the [Sample] command: *)

Sample (returnGen 42).
(** 
     ===>
         [42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42] 
*)

(** Next, given a random generator for [A] and a _function_ [f] taking
    an element of [A] and yielding a random generator for [B], we can
    plumb the two together into a generator for [B] that works by
    internally generating a random [A] and applying [f] to it. *)

Check bindGen.
(** 
     ===> 
        bindGen : G ?A -> (?A -> G ?B) -> G ?B 
*) 

(** (Of course, the implementation of [bindGen] must take care
    to pass different random seeds to the two sub-generators!) *)

(** With these two primitives in hand, we can make [G] an instance of
    the [Monad] typeclass. *)

(** (This [Instance] should really be defined
    within QuickChick itself, but it is not at the moment.) *)

Instance gMonad : `{Monad G} | 3 :=
  {
    ret := @returnGen;
    bind := @bindGen
  }.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Primitive generators *)

(** Next, QuickChick provides primitive generators for "ordered
    types."  They are accessed via the [choose] combinator. *)

Check @choose.
(** 
     ===> 
        @choose
           : forall A : Type, ChoosableFromInterval A -> A * A -> G A  
*)

(** The [ChoosableFromInterval] typeclass describes primitive types
    [A], like natural numbers and integers ([Z]), for which it makes
    sense to randomly generate elements from a given interval. *)

Print ChoosableFromInterval. 
(** 
===>
Record ChoosableFromInterval (A : Type) : Type := Build_ChoosableFromInterval
  { super : Ord A;
    randomR : A * A -> RandomSeed -> A * RandomSeed;
    ...
  }.
*)

Sample (choose (0,10)).
(** 
     ===> 
       [ 1, 2, 1, 9, 8, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 4, 10, 4, 6 ] 
*)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, optional (cfi)  *)
(** Print out the full definition of [ChoosableFromInterval].  Can you
    understand what it means?  [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Lists *)

(** Since they are a very commonly used compound datatype, lists have
    special combinators in QuickChick: [listOf] and [vectorOf]. *)

(** The [listOf] combinator takes as input a generator for elements of
    type [A] and returns a generator for lists of [A]s. *)

Check listOf.
(** 
     ===> 
      listOf : G ?A -> G (list ?A) 
*)

Sample (listOf (choose (0,4))).
(** 
     ===> 
      [ [ 0, 3, 2, 0 ], 
        [ 1, 3, 4, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 1 ], 
        [ 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1 ], 
        [ 0 ], 
        [ 4, 2, 3 ], 
        [ 3, 3, 4, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1 ], 
        [ 0, 4 ], 
        [  ], 
        [ 1, 0, 1, 3, 1 ], 
        [ 0, 0 ], 
        [ 1, 4 ], 
        [ 4, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0 ], 
        [ 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 4 ], 
        [ 2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 3 ], 
        [ 4, 3, 3, 0, 1 ], 
        [ 3, 3, 3 ], 
        [ 3, 2, 4 ], 
        [ 1, 2 ], 
        [  ], 
        [  ] ]
*)

(** The second combinator, [vectorOf], receives an additional numeric
    argument [n], the length of the list to be generated. *)

Check vectorOf.
(** 
     ===> 
      vectorOf : nat -> G ?A -> G (list ?A) 
*)

Sample (vectorOf 3 (choose (0,4))).
(** 
     ===> 
      [ [0, 1, 4], 
        [1, 1, 0], 
        [3, 3, 3], 
        [0, 2, 1], 
        [1, 3, 2], 
        [3, 3, 0], 
        [3, 0, 4], 
        [2, 3, 3], 
        [3, 2, 4], 
        [1, 2, 3], 
        [2, 0, 4]  ]
*)

(** This raises a question.  It's clear how [vectorOf] decides how big
    to make its lists (we tell it!), but how does [listOf] do it?  The
    answer is hidden inside [G].
  
    In addition to handling random-seed plumbing, the [G] monad also
    maintains a "current maximum size" (in the style of a "reader
    monad", if you like that terminology): a natural number that
    can be used as an upper bound on the depth of generated objects. *)

(** Internally, [G A] is just a synonym for [nat -> RandomSeed -> A]. *)

Module DefineG.

Inductive G (A:Type) : Type :=
| MkG : (nat -> RandomSeed -> A) -> G A.

End DefineG.

(** When it is searching for counterexamples, QuickChick progressively
    tries larger and larger values for the size bound [n], in order to
    explore larger and deeper part of the search space.

    Each generator can choose to interpret the size bound however it
    wants, and there is no enforced guarantee that generators pay
    attention to it at all; however, it is good practice to respect
    this bound when programming new generators. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Custom Generators *)

(** Naturally, we often need generators involving user-defined
    datatypes.  Here's a simple one to play with: *)

Inductive color := Red | Green | Blue | Yellow.

(** In order for commands like [Sample] to display colors, we should
    make [color] an instance of the [Show] typeclass: *)

Require Import String. Open Scope string.
Instance show_color : Show color :=
  {| show c :=
       match c with
         | Red    => "Red"
         | Green  => "Green"
         | Blue   => "Blue"
         | Yellow => "Yellow"
       end
  |}.

(** Now, to generate a random color, we just need to pick one of the
    constructors [Red], [Green], [Blue], or [Yellow]. This is done
    using [elements]. *)

Check elements.
(** 
     ===> 
      elements : ?A -> list ?A -> G ?A 
*)

Definition genColor' : G color :=
  elements Red [ Red ; Green ; Blue ; Yellow ].

Sample genColor'.
(** 
     ===> 
     [Red, Green, Blue, Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red] 
*)

(** The first argument to [elements] serves as a default result.  If
    its list argument is not empty, [elements] returns a generator
    that always picks an element of that list; otherwise the generator
    always returns the default object.  This makes Coq's totality
    checker happy, but makes [elements] a little awkward to use, since
    typically its second argument will be a non-empty constant list. *)

(** To make the common case smoother, QuickChick provides convenient
    notations that automatically extract the default element. *)

(** 

     " 'elems' [ x ] " := elements x (cons x nil)
     " 'elems' [ x ; y ] " := elements x (cons x (cons y nil))
     " 'elems' [ x ; y ; .. ; z ] " := elements x
     " 'elems' ( x ;; l ) " := elements x (cons x l)
*)

(** Armed with [elems], we can write a [color] generator the way we'd
    hope. *)

Definition genColor : G color :=
  elems [ Red ; Green ; Blue ; Yellow ].

Sample genColor.
(** 
      ===> 
       [Red, Green, Blue, Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red] 
*)

(** For more complicated ADTs, QuickChick provides more combinators.
    We will showcase these using everyone's favorite datatype: trees! *)

(** Our trees are standard polymorphic binary trees; either [Leaf]s or
    [Node]s containing some payload of type [A] and two subtrees. *)

Inductive Tree A :=
| Leaf : Tree A
| Node : A -> Tree A -> Tree A -> Tree A.

Arguments Leaf {A}.
Arguments Node {A} _ _ _.

(** Before getting to generators for trees, we again give a
    straightforward [Show] instance.  (The need for a local [let fix]
    declaration stems from the fact that Coq's typeclasses (unlike
    Haskell's) are not automatically recursive.  We could
    alternatively define [aux] with a separate top-level
    [Fixpoint].) *) 

Instance showTree {A} `{_ : Show A} : Show (Tree A) :=
  {| show := 
       let fix aux t :=
         match t with
           | Leaf => "Leaf"
           | Node x l r =>
               "Node (" ++ show x ++ ") (" ++ aux l ++ ") (" ++ aux r ++ ")"
         end
       in aux
  |}.

(** Now we come to the first _generator combinator_, called [oneof]. *)

Check oneof.
(** 
      ===> 
       oneof : G ?A -> list (G ?A) -> G ?A 
*)

(** This combinator takes a default generator and a list of
    generators, and it picks one of the generators from the list
    uniformly at random (as long as the list is not empty, in which
    case it picks from the default generator).  As for [elements],
    QuickChick introduces a more convenient notation [oneOf] to hide
    this default element. *)

(** At this point, Coq's termination checker is going to save us from
    shooting ourselves in the foot. The "obvious" first generator that
    one might write is the following function [genTree], which
    generates either a [Leaf] or else a [Node] whose subtrees are
    generated recursively (and whose payload is produced by a
    generator [g] for elements of type [A]).*)

(**

     Fixpoint genTree {A} (g : G A) : G (Tree A) :=
        oneOf [ ret Leaf ;;
                liftM3 Node g (genTree g) (genTree g) ].
*)

(** Of course, this fixpoint will not pass Coq's termination
    checker. Attempting to justify this fixpoint informally, one might
    first say that at some point the random generation will pick a
    [Leaf] so it will eventually terminate.  But the termination
    checker cannot understand this kind of probabilistic reasoning.
    Moreover, even informally, the reasoning is wrong: Every time we
    choose to generate a [Node], we create two separate branches that
    must both be terminated with leaves.  From this, it is not hard to
    show that the _expected_ size of the generated trees is actually
    infinite! *)

(** The solution is to use the standard "fuel" idiom that all Coq
    users know.  We add an additional natural number [sz] as a
    parameter.  We decrease this size in each recursive call, and when
    it reaches [O], we always generate [Leaf].  Thus, the initial [sz]
    parameter serves as a bound on the depth of the tree. *)

Fixpoint genTreeSized {A} (sz : nat) (g : G A) : G (Tree A) :=
  match sz with
    | O => ret Leaf
    | S sz' => oneOf
                 [ ret Leaf ;
                   liftM3 Node g (genTreeSized sz' g) (genTreeSized sz' g)
                 ]
  end.

Sample (genTreeSized 3 (choose(0,3))).
(** 
      ===> 
       [ Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Node (3) (Node (0) (Leaf) (Leaf))
                  (Node (2) (Leaf) (Node (3) (Leaf) (Leaf))),
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Node (1) (Leaf) (Node (1) (Leaf) (Node (0) (Leaf) (Leaf))),
         Leaf,
         Node (3) (Leaf) (Leaf),
         Node (1) (Leaf) (Leaf),
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Node (0) (Leaf) (Node (0) (Leaf) (Node (2) (Leaf) (Leaf))),
         Node (0) (Node (2) (Node (3) (Leaf) (Leaf)) (Leaf)) (Leaf),
         Node (0) (Leaf) (Leaf),
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Leaf,
         Leaf ]
*)

(** While this generator succeeds in avoiding nontermination, we can
    see just by observing the result of [Sample] that there is a
    problem: [genTreeSized] produces way too many [Leaf]s!  This is
    actually to be expected, since half the time we generate a [Leaf]
    right at the outset.  *)

(** We can obtain bigger trees more often if we skew the distribution
    towards [Node]s using the most expressive QuickChick combinator,
    [frequency] and its associated default-lifting notation [freq]. *)

Check frequency.
(** 
      ===> 
       frequency : G ?A -> seq (nat * G ?A) -> G ?A 
*)

(** A more convenient derived notation, [freq], takes a list of
    generators, each tagged with a natural number that serves as the
    weight of that generator.  For example, in the following
    generator, a [Leaf] will be generated 1 / (sz + 1) of the time and
    a [Node] the remaining sz / (sz + 1) of the time. *)

Fixpoint genTreeSized' {A} (sz : nat) (g : G A) : G (Tree A) :=
  match sz with
    | O => ret Leaf 
    | S sz' =>
        freq [ (1,  ret Leaf) ;
               (sz, liftM3 Node g (genTreeSized' sz' g)
                                  (genTreeSized' sz' g))
             ]
  end.

Sample (genTreeSized' 3 (choose(0,3))).

(** ** Checkers *)

(** To showcase how such generators can be used to find
    counterexamples, suppose we define a function for "mirroring" a
    tree -- swapping its left and right subtrees recursively. *)
   
Fixpoint mirror {A : Type} (t : Tree A) : Tree A :=
  match t with
    | Leaf => Leaf
    | Node x l r => Node x (mirror r) (mirror l)
  end.

(** To formulate a property about [mirror], we also need a simple
    structural equality on trees: *)

Fixpoint eq_tree (t1 t2 : Tree nat) : bool :=
  match t1, t2 with
    | Leaf, Leaf => true
    | Node x1 l1 r1, Node x2 l2 r2 =>
      beq_nat x1 x2 && eq_tree l1 l2 && eq_tree r1 r2
    | _, _ => false
  end.

(** We expect that [mirror] should be "unipotent": mirroring a tree
    twice yields the original tree.  *)

Definition mirrorP (t : Tree nat) := eq_tree (mirror (mirror t)) t.

(** Now we want to use our generator to create a lot of random trees
    and, for each one, check whether [mirrorP] returns [true] or
    [false].  That is, we want to use [mirrorP] to build a _generator
    for test results_. *)

(** Let's open a playground module so we can show simplified versions
    of the actual QuickChick definitions. *)

Module CheckerPlayground1.

(** First, we need a type of test results -- let's call it [Result].
    For the moment, think of [Result] as just an enumerated type with
    constructors [Success] and [Failure].  *)

Inductive Result := Success | Failure.

Instance showResult : Show Result :=
  {
    show r := match r with Success => "Success" | Failure => "Failure" end
  }.

(** Then we can define the type [Checker] to be [G Result]. *)

Definition Checker := G Result.

(** That is, a [Checker] embodies some way of performing a randomized
    test about the truth of some proposition, which will yield either
    [Success] (meaning that the proposition survived this test) or
    [Failure] (meaning that this test demonstrated that the
    proposition was false).  Sampling a [Checker] many times causes
    many different tests to be performed. *)

(** To check [mirrorP], we'll need a way to build a [Checker] out of a
    function from trees to booleans.  But let's start simpler and see
    how to build a [Checker] out of a [bool]. *)

(** Actually, we will be wanting to build [Checker]s based on many
    different types.  So let's begin by defining a typeclass
    [Checkable], where an instance for [Checkable A] provides a way of
    converting an [A] into a [Checker]. *)

Class Checkable A :=
  {
    checker : A -> Checker
  }.

(** Now we want to give a [bool] instance for [Checkable]. *)

Instance checkableBool : Checkable bool :=
  {
    checker b := if b then ret Success else ret Failure
  }.

(** That is, the boolean value [true] passes every test we might
    subject it to, while [false] fails all tests. *)

(** Let's see what happens if we sample checkers for our favorite
    booleans, [true] and [false].  *)

(** (We need to exit the playground so that we can do [Sample],
    because [Sample] is implemented internally via extraction to
    OCaml, which usually does not work from inside a [Module].) *)

*)

(** What we've done so far may look a a bit strange, since these
    checkers always generate constant results.  We'll make things more
    interesting in a bit, but first let's pause to define one more
    basic instance of [Checkable]. *)

(** A decidable [Prop] is not too different from a boolean, so we
    should be able to build a checker from that. *)

Export CheckerPlayground1.

(** (The definition looks a bit strange since it doesn't use its
    argument [p].  The intuition is that all the information in [p] is
    already encoded in [P]!) *)

(** Now suppose we pose a couple of (decidable) conjectures: *)

Conjecture c1 : 0 = 42.
Conjecture c2 : 41 + 1 = 42.

End CheckerPlayground2.

(** The somewhat astononishing thing about the [Checkable] instance we
    defined is that, even though these are _conjectures_ (we haven't
    proved them, so the "evidence" that Coq has for them internally is
    just an uninstantiated "evar"), but -- because the [Checkable]
    instance for decidable properties does not look at its argument --
    we can still build checkers from them and sample from these
    checkers! *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Shrinking *)

(** Shrinking (sometimes known as "delta debugging") is a process
    that, given a counterexample to some property, searches (greedily)
    for smaller counterexamples.

    Given a shrinking function [s] of type [A -> list A] and a value
    [x] of type [A] that is known to falsify some property [P],
    QuickChick (lazily) tries [P] on all members of [s x] until it
    finds another counterexample.  It then repeats this process
    starting from this counterexample, until it reaches a point where
    [x] fails property [P] but every element of [s x] succeeds.  This
    [x] is then a minimal counterexample. *)

(** Clearly, this greedy algorithm onlys work if all elements of
    [s x] are strictly "smaller" than [x] for all [x] (that is, there
    should be some total order on the type of [x] such that [s] is
    strictly decreasing in this order).  This is the basic correctness
    requirement for a shrinker. *)

(** Here is a very simple shrinker for [color]s. *)

Instance shrinkColor : Shrink color :=
  {
    shrink c :=
      match c with
      | Red => [ ]
      | Green => [ Red ]
      | Blue => [ Red; Green ]
      | Yellow => [ Red; Green; Blue ]
      end
  }.

(** Most of the time, shrinking functions should try to return
    elements that are "one step smaller" than the one they are
    given. For example, consider the default shrinking function for
    lists provided by QuickChick. *)

Print shrinkList.
(** 
===> 
  shrinkList = 
    fun (A : Type) (H : Shrink A) => 
       {| shrink := shrinkListAux shrink |}
  : forall A : Type, Shrink A -> Shrink (list A)
*)

Print shrinkListAux.
(** 
===> 
  shrinkListAux = 
    fix shrinkListAux (A : Type) (shr : A -> list A) (l : list A) :
      list (list A) :=
      match l with
      | [] => []
      | x :: xs =>
          ((xs :: map (fun xs' : list A => x :: xs') 
                      (shrinkListAux A shr xs)) ++
           map (fun x' : A => x' :: xs) (shr x))
      end

  : forall A : Type, (A -> list A) -> list A -> list (list A)
*)

(** An empty list cannot be shrunk - there is no smaller list.  A cons
    cell can be shrunk in three ways: by returning the tail of the
    list, by shrinking the tail of the list and keeping the same head,
    or by shrinking the head and keeping the same tail. By induction,
    this process can generate all smaller lists.

    (Pro tip: One refinement to the advice that shrinkers should
    return "one step smaller" values is that, for potentially large
    data structures, it can sometimes greatly improve performance if a
    shrinker returns not only all the "slightly smaller" structures
    but also one or two "much smaller" structures.  E.g. for a number
    [x] greater than [2], we might shrink to [0; x div 2; pred x].) *)

(** Writing a shrinking instance for trees is equally straightforward:
    we don't shrink [Leaf]s while for [Node]s we can return the left
    or right subtrees, shrink the payload or one of the subtrees. *)

  end.

(** * Putting it all Together *)

(** Now we've got pretty much all the basic machinery we need, but the
    way we write properties -- using [forAllShrink] and explicitly
    providing generators and shrinkers -- is a bit heavy.  We can use
    a bit more typeclass magic to lighten things.

    First, we introduce a typeclass [Gen A] with a single operator
    [arbitrary] of type [G A]. *)

(** * Sized Generators *)

(** Back to trees.

    To build an [Arbitrary] instance for trees, we would like to use
    [genTreeSized']; however, that generator takes an additional
    [size] argument.  Fortunately, since the [G] monad itself includes
    a size argument, we can "plumb" this argument into generators like
    [genTreeSized'].  In other words, we can define an operator
    [sized] that takes a sized generator and produces an unsized
    one. *)

    sorted, and, if it is, proceed to check the conclusion. If it is
    not, it will discard the generated inputs and try again. As we can
    see, this can lead to many discarded tests (here, almost twice as
    many as successful ones!) which waste a lot of CPU time and leads
    to inefficient testing. *)
