(** * A First Taste of Testing *)

(** Consider the following definition of a function [remove], which
    takes a natural number [x] and a list of nats [l] and removes [x]
    from the list. *)

Fixpoint remove (x : nat) (l : list nat) : list nat :=
  match l with
    | []   => []
    | h::t => if beq_nat h x then t else h :: remove x t
  end.

(** One possible specification for [remove] might be this property... *)

Conjecture removeP : forall x l,  ~ (In x (remove x l)).

(** ...which says that [x] never occurs in the result of [remove x l]
    for any [x] and [l].

    ([Conjecture foo...] means the same as [Theorem foo... Admitted.]
    Formally, [foo] is treated as an axiom in what follows.) *)

(** Sadly, this property is false, as we would (eventually) discover
    if we were to try to prove it. *)

(** A different -- possibly much more efficient -- way to discover
    the discrepancy between the definition and specification is
    to _test_ it: *)

QuickChick removeP.

(** The [QuickChick] command takes a property (which must be
    "executable" -- we'll see later exactly what this means) and
    attempts to falsify it by running it on many randomly
    generated inputs, resulting in output like this:

    0
    [0, 0]
    Failed! After 17 tests and 12 shrinks

    This means that, if run [remove] with [x] being [0] and [l]
    the two-element list containing two zeros, then the property
    [removeP] fails. *)

(** With this example in hand, we can see that the [then] branch
    of [remove] fails to make a recursive call, which means that only
    one occurence of [x] will be deleted. The last line of the output
    records that it took 17 tests to identify some fault-inducing
    input and 12 "shrinks" to reduce it to a minimal
    counterexample. *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star (insert)  *)
(** Here is a somewhat mangled definition of a function for inserting a
   new element into a sorted list of numbers: *)

Fixpoint insert x l :=
  match l with
  | [] => [x]
  | y::t => if y <? x then insert x t else y::t
  end.

(** Write a property that says "inserting a number [x] into a list [l]
    always yields a list containing [x]."  Make sure QuickChick finds
    a counterexample. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (insert2)  *)
(** Write a property that says "inserting a number [x] into a list [l]
    yields a list containing every member of [l]."  Make sure
    QuickChick finds a counterexample. (N.b. There is a way to do this
    using just what we've seen, though it's arguably not the best
    way.) *)

(** * Overview *)

(** Property-based random testing involves four basic ingredients:

    - an _executable property_ like [removeP],
    - _generators_ for random elements of the types of the inputs to
      the property (here, numbers and lists of numbers),
    - _printers_ for converting data structures like numbers and lists
      to strings when reporting counterexamples, and
    - _shrinkers_, which are used to minimize counterexamples. *)

(** We will delve into each of these in detail later on, but first we
    need to make a digression to explain Coq's support for
    _typeclasses_, which QuickChick uses extensively both internally
    and in its programmatic interface to users.  This is
    [Typeclasses].

    Next ([QC]) we'll cover the core concepts and features of
    QuickChick itself.

    The [TImp] chapter develops a small case study around a typed
    variant of the Imp language.

    Finally, a larger case study on property-based testing of a small
    compiler appears as the [CompilerTest] chapter of the [vminus]
    volume. *)
