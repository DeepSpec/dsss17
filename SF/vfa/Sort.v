(** * Sort: Insertion sort *)

(** Sorting can be done in O(N log N) time by various
    algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, etc.).  But for
    smallish inputs, a simple quadratic-time algorithm such as
    insertion sort can actually be faster.  And it's certainly easier
    to implement -- and to prove correct. *)

(** * Recommended reading *)

(** If you don't already know how insertion sort works, see Wikipedia
    or read any standard textbook; for example:

   Sections 2.0 and 2.1 of _Algorithms, Fourth Edition_,
       by Sedgewick and Wayne, Addison Wesley 2011;  or

   Section 2.1 of _Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition_,
       by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, MIT Press 2009. *)

(** * The insertion-sort program *)

(** Insertion sort is usually presented as an imperative program
   operating on arrays.  But it works just as well as a functional
   program operating on linked lists! *)

Require Import Perm.

Fixpoint insert (i:nat) (l: list nat) :=
  match l with
  | nil => i::nil
  | h::t => if i <=? h then i::h::t else h :: insert i t
 end.

Fixpoint sort (l: list nat) : list nat :=
  match l with
  | nil => nil
  | h::t => insert h (sort t)
end.

Example sort_pi: sort [3;1;4;1;5;9;2;6;5;3;5]
                    = [1;1;2;3;3;4;5;5;5;6;9].
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

(** What Sedgewick/Wayne and Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest don't acknowlege
    is that the arrays-and-swaps model of sorting is not the only one
    in the world.  We are writing _functional programs_, where our
    sequences are (typically) represented as linked lists, and where
    we do _not_ destructively splice elements into those lists.
    Instead, we build new lists that (sometimes) share structure with
    the old ones.

    So, for example: *)

Eval compute in insert 7 [1; 3; 4; 8; 12; 14; 18].
(* = [1; 3; 4; 7; 8; 12; 14; 18] *)

(** The tail of this list, [12::14::18::nil], is not disturbed or
   rebuilt by the [insert] algorithm.  The nodes [1::3::4::7::_] are
   new, constructed by [insert].  The first three nodes of the old
   list, [1::3::4::_] will likely be garbage-collected, if no other
   data structure is still pointing at them.  Thus, in this typical
   case,
     - Time cost = 4X
     - Space cost = (4-3)Y = Y

   where X and Y are constants, independent of the length of the tail.
   The value Y is the number of bytes in one list node: 2 to 4 words,
   depending on how the implementation handles constructor-tags.
   We write (4-3) to indicate that four list nodes are constructed,
   while three list nodes become eligible for garbage collection.

   We will not _prove_ such things about the time and space cost, but
   they are _true_ anyway, and we should keep them in
   consideration. *)

(** * Specification of correctness *)

(** A sorting algorithm must rearrange the elements into a list that
    is totally ordered. *)

Inductive sorted: list nat -> Prop :=
| sorted_nil:
    sorted nil
| sorted_1: forall x,
    sorted (x::nil)
| sorted_cons: forall x y l,
   x <= y -> sorted (y::l) -> sorted (x::y::l).

(** Is this really the right definition of what it means for a list to
    be sorted?  One might have thought that it should go more like this: *)

Definition sorted' (al: list nat) :=
 forall i j, i < j < length al -> nth i al 0 <= nth j al 0.

(** This is a reasonable definition too.  It should be equivalent.
    Later on, we'll prove that the two definitions really are
    equivalent.  For now, let's use the first one to define what it
    means to be a correct sorting algorthm. *)

Definition is_a_sorting_algorithm (f: list nat -> list nat) :=
  forall al, Permutation al (f al) /\ sorted (f al).

(** The result [(f al)] should not only be a [sorted] sequence,
    but it should be some rearrangement (Permutation) of the input sequence. *)

(** * Proof of correctness *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars  *)
(** Prove the following auxiliary lemma, [insert_perm], which will be
    useful for proving [sort_perm] below.  Your proof will be by
    induction, but you'll need some of the permutation facts from the
    library, so first remind yourself by doing [SearchAbout]. *)

(** This one is a bit tricky.  However, there just a single induction

   or [sort_perm]. *)

(** * Making sure the specification is right *)

(** It's really important to get the _specification_ right.  You can
    prove that your program satisfies its specification (and Coq will
    check that proof for you), but you can't prove that you have the
    right specification.  Therefore, we take the trouble to write two
    different specifications of sortedness ([sorted] and [sorted']),
    and prove that they mean the same thing.  This increases our
    confidence that we have the right specification, though of course
    it doesn't _prove_ that we do. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, optional (sorted_sorted')  *)
Lemma sorted_sorted': forall al, sorted al -> sorted' al.

(** Hint: Instead of doing induction on the list [al], do induction
    on the _sortedness_ of [al]. This proof is a bit tricky, so
    you may have to think about how to approach it, and try out
    one or two different ideas.*)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, optional (sorted'_sorted)  *)
Lemma sorted'_sorted: forall al, sorted' al -> sorted al.

(** Here, you can't do induction on the sorted'-ness of the list,
    because [sorted'] is not an inductive predicate. *)

Proof.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Proving correctness from the alternate spec *)

(** Depending on how you write the specification of a program, it can
    be _much_ harder or easier to prove correctness.  We saw that the
    predicates [sorted] and [sorted'] are equivalent; but it is really
    difficult to prove correctness of insertion sort directly from
    [sorted'].

    Try it yourself, if you dare!  I managed it, but my proof is quite
    long and complicated.  I found that I needed all these facts:
    - [insert_perm], [sort_perm]
    - [Forall_perm], [Permutation_length]
    - [Permutation_sym], [Permutation_trans]
    - a new lemma [Forall_nth], stated below.

    Maybe you will find a better way that's not so complicated.

    DO NOT USE [sorted_sorted'], [sorted'_sorted], [insert_sorted], or
    [sort_sorted] in these proofs! *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The moral of this story *)

(** The proofs of [insert_sorted] and [sort_sorted] were easy; the
    proofs of [insert_sorted'] and [sort_sorted'] were difficult; and
    yet [sorted al <-> sorted' al].  _Different formulations of the
    functional specification can lead to great differences in the
    difficulty of the correctness proofs_.

   Suppose someone required you to prove [sort_sorted'], and never
   mentioned the [sorted] predicate to you.  Instead of proving
   [sort_sorted'] directly, it would be much easier to design a new
   predicate ([sorted]), and then prove [sort_sorted] and
   [sorted_sorted']. *)
