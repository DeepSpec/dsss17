(** * SearchTree: Binary search trees *)

(** Binary search trees are an efficient data structure for
   lookup tables, that is, mappings from keys to values.
   The [total_map] type from Maps.v is an _inefficient_
   implementation: if you add N items to your total_map,
   then looking them up takes N comparisons in the worst case,
   and N/2 comparisons in the average case.

   In contrast, if your [key] type is a total order -- that is,
   if it has a less-than comparison that's transitive and
   antisymmetric [ a<b <->  ~(b<a) ] -- then one can implement
   binary search trees (BSTs).   We will assume you know how BSTs
   work; you can learn this from:
   - Section 3.2 of  _Algorithms, Fourth Edition_,
       by Sedgewick and Wayne, Addison Wesley 2011;  or
   - Chapter 12 of _Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition_,
       by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, MIT Press 2009.

   Our focus here is to _prove the correctness of an implementation_
   of binary search trees. *)

(** * What should we prove about search trees? *)

(** Search trees are meant to be an implementation of maps.
   That is, they have an [insert] function that corresponds to the
   [update] function of a map, and a [lookup] function that
   corresponds to applying the map to an argument.  To prove the
   correctness of a search-tree algorithm, we can prove:
   - Any search tree corresponds to some map, using a function or
         relation that we demonstrate.
   - The lookup function gives the same result as applying the map
   - The insert function returns a corresponding map.
   - Maps have the properties we actually wanted.  It would do no
     good to prove that searchtrees correspond to some abstract
     type X, if X didn't have useful properties!

  What properties do we want searchtrees to have?  If I insert
  the binding [(k,v)] into a searchtree [t], then look up [k], I
  should get [v]. If I look up [k'] in [insert (k,v) t], where [k'<>k],
  then I should get the same result as [lookup k t].  There are several
  more properties. Fortunately, all these properties are already proved
  about [total_map] in the [Maps] module: *)

Check t_update_eq. (*  : forall (A : Type) (m : total_map A) (x : id) (v : A),
       t_update m x v x = v   *)
Check t_update_neq.  (* : forall (X : Type) (v : X) (x1 x2 : id) (m : total_map X),
       x1 <> x2 -> t_update m x1 v x2 = m x2    *)
Check t_update_shadow.  (* : forall (A : Type) (m : total_map A) (v1 v2 : A) (x : id),
       t_update (t_update m x v1) x v2 = t_update m x v2    *)
Check t_update_same.  (* : forall (X : Type) (x : id) (m : total_map X),
        t_update m x (m x) = m    *)
Check t_update_permute. (* forall (X : Type) (v1 v2 : X) (x1 x2 : id) (m : total_map X),
       x2 <> x1 ->
       t_update (t_update m x2 v2) x1 v1 =
         t_update (t_update m x1 v1) x2 v2    *)
Check t_apply_empty. (* : forall (A : Type) (x : id) (v : A),
       t_empty v x = v *)

(** So, if we like those properties that [total_map] is proved to have,
   and we can prove that searchtrees behave like maps, then we don't
   have to reprove each individual property about searchtrees.

   More generally:  a job worth doing is worth doing well.
   It does no good to prove the "correctness" of a program, if you
   prove that it satisfies a wrong or useless specification. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Efficiency of search trees *)
(** We use binary search trees because they are efficient.  That is,
     if there are [N] elements in a (reasonably well balanced) BST,
     each insertion or lookup takes about logN time.

     What could go wrong?

     1.  The search tree might not be balanced.  In that case, each
           insertion or lookup will take as much as linear time.

	   - SOLUTION: use an algorithm, such as "red-black trees",
	   that ensures the trees stay balanced.  We'll do that in
           Chapter [RedBlack].

     2.  Our keys are natural numbers, and Coq's [nat] type takes
           linear time _per comparison_.  That is, computing (j <? k)
           takes time proportional to the _value_ of [k-j].

	   - SOLUTION: represent keys by a data type that has a more
           efficient comparison operator.  We just use [nat] in this
           chapter because it's something you're already familiar with.

     3.  There's no notion of "run time" in Coq.  That is, we can't
          say what it means that a Coq function "takes N steps to
          evaluate."  Therefore, we can't prove that binary search
          trees are efficient.

	  - SOLUTION 1: Don't prove (in Coq) that they're efficient;
          just prove that they are correct.  Prove things about their
          efficiency the old-fashioned way, on pencil and paper.

	  - SOLUTION 2: Prove in Coq some facts about the height of
          the trees, which have direct bearing on their efficiency.
          We'll explore that in later chapters.

      4.  Our functions in Coq aren't real implementations; they are
          just pretend models of real implementations.  What if there
          are bugs in the correspondence between the Coq function and
          the real implementation?

          - SOLUTION: Use Coq's [extraction] feature to derive the
	    real implementation (in Ocaml or Haskell) automatically
	    from the Coq function.  Or, use Coq's [vm_compute] or
	    [native_compute] feature to compile and run the programs
	    efficiently inside Coq.  We'll explore [extraction] in a
	    later chapter. *)

(** * Proof of correctness *)

(** We claim that a [tree] "corresponds" to a [total_map].
     So we must exhibit an "abstraction relation"
     [Abs: tree -> total_map V -> Prop].

    The idea is that [Abs t m] says that tree [t]
    is a representation of map [m]; or that map [m]
    is an abstraction of tree [t].  How should we
    define this abstraction relation?

    The empty tree is easy:   [Abs E (fun x => default)].

    Now, what about this tree?: *)

(** What went wrong?  Clearly, [elements_relate] is true; you just

    binary search tree, because there's a 3 in the left subtree of the

    If you wrote a good answer to the [elements_relate_informal]

  that the [elements] function will encounter), have the [SearchTree]
  property?  Well, the empty tree is a [SearchTree]; and if you insert
  into a tree that's a [SearchTree], then the result is a
  [SearchTree]; and these are the only ways that you're supposed to
  build trees.  So we need to prove those two theorems. *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star (empty_tree_SearchTree)  *)
Theorem empty_tree_SearchTree:  SearchTree empty_tree.
Proof.
clear default.  (* This is here to avoid a nasty interaction between Admitted
   and Section/Variable.  It's also a hint that the [default] value
   is not needed in this theorem. *)
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Remark omega_on_keys:
   forall i j : key, ~ (i > j) -> ~ (i < j) -> i=j.
Proof.
intros.
try omega.  (* Oops! [omega] cannot solve this one.
    The problem is that [i] and [j] have type [key] instead of type [nat].
    The solution is easy enough: *)
unfold key in *.
omega.

(** So, if you get stuck on an [omega] that ought to work,
   try unfolding the types from [key] to [nat] *)

Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (insert_SearchTree)  *)
Theorem insert_SearchTree:

   SearchTree t -> SearchTree (insert k v t).

(** * We got lucky.  *)

(** Recall the statement of [lookup_relate]: *)

Check lookup_relate.
(*  forall (k : key) (t : tree) (cts : total_map V),
       Abs t cts -> lookup k t = cts (Id k)  *)

(** In general, to prove that a function satisfies the abstraction relation,
   one also needs to use the representation invariant.  That was certainly
   the case with [elements_relate]: *)

Check elements_relate.
(*  : forall (t : tree) (cts : total_map V),
       SearchTree t -> Abs t cts -> elements_property t cts   *)

(** To put that another way, the general form of [lookup_relate] should be: *)

Lemma lookup_relate':
  forall (k : key) (t : tree) (cts : total_map V),
     SearchTree t -> Abs t cts -> lookup k t = cts (Id k).

(** That is certainly provable, since it's a weaker statement than what we proved: *)

Proof.
intros.
apply lookup_relate.
apply H0.
Qed.

Theorem insert_relate':
 forall k v t cts,
    SearchTree t ->
    Abs t cts ->
    Abs (insert k v t) (t_update cts (Id k) v).
Proof. intros. apply insert_relate; auto.
Qed.

(** The question is, why did we not need the representation invariant in
   the proof of [lookup_relate]?  The answer is that our particular Abs
   relation is much more clever than necessary:  *)

Print Abs.
(* Inductive Abs : tree -> total_map V -> Prop :=
    Abs_E : Abs E (t_empty default)
  | Abs_T : forall (a b: total_map V) (l: tree) (k: key) (v: V) (r: tree),
            Abs l a ->
            Abs r b ->
	    Abs (T l k v r) (t_update (combine k a b) (Id k) v)
*)
(** Because the [combine] function is chosen very carefully, it turns out
  that this abstraction relation even works on bogus trees! *)

Remark abstraction_of_bogus_tree:
 forall v2 v3,
   Abs (T (T E 3 v3 E) 2 v2 E) (t_update (t_empty default) (Id 2) v2).
Proof.
intros.
evar (m: total_map V).
replace  (t_update (t_empty default) (Id 2) v2) with m; subst m.
repeat constructor.
extensionality x; destruct x as [x].
unfold t_update, combine, t_empty, beq_id.
bdestruct (2 =? x).
auto.
bdestruct (x <? 2).
bdestruct (3 =? x).
(* LOOK HERE! *)
omega.
bdestruct (x <? 3).
auto.
auto.
auto.
Qed.

(** Step through the proof to [LOOK HERE], and notice what's going on.
   Just when it seems that [(T (T E 3 v3 E) 2 v2 E)] is about to produce [v3]
  while [(t_update (t_empty default) (Id 2) v2)] is about to produce [default],
  [omega] finds a contradiction.  What's happening is that [combine 2]
  is careful to ignore any keys >= 2 in the left-hand subtree.

  For that reason, [Abs] matches the _actual_ behavior of [lookup],
  even on bogus trees.  But that's a really strong condition!  We should
  not have to care about the behavior of [lookup] (and [insert]) on
  bogus trees.  We should not need to prove anything about it, either.

  Sure, it's convenient in this case that the abstraction relation is able to
  cope with ill-formed trees.  But in general, when proving correctness of
  abstract-data-type (ADT) implementations, it may be a lot of extra
  effort to make the abstraction relation as heavy-duty as that.
  It's often much easier for the abstraction relation to assume that the
  representation is well formed.  Thus, the general statement of our
  correctness theorems will be more like [lookup_relate'] than like
  [lookup_relate].  *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Every well-formed tree does actually relate to an abstraction *)

(** We're not quite done yet.  We would like to know that
    _every tree that satisfies the representation invariant, means something_.

   So as a general sanity check, we need the following theorem: *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (can_relate)  *)
Lemma can_relate:
 forall t,  SearchTree t -> exists cts, Abs t cts.
Proof.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** Now, because we happen to have a super-strong abstraction relation, that
   even works on bogus trees, we can prove a super-strong can_relate function: *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (unrealistically_strong_can_relate)  *)
Lemma unrealistically_strong_can_relate:
 forall t,  exists cts, Abs t cts.
Proof.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * It wasn't really luck, actually *)

(** In the previous section, I said, "we got lucky that the abstraction
    relation that I happened to choose had this super-strong property."

    But actually, the first time I tried to prove correctness of search trees,
    I did _not_ get lucky.  I chose a different abstraction relation: *)

Definition AbsX (t: tree) (m: total_map V) : Prop :=
    list2map (elements t) = m.

(** It's easy to prove that [elements] respects this abstraction relation: *)

Theorem elements_relateX:
  forall t cts,
  SearchTree t ->
  AbsX t cts ->
  list2map (elements t) = cts.
Proof.
intros.
apply H0.
Qed.

(** But it's not so easy to prove that [lookup] and [insert] respect this
    relation.  For example, the following claim is not true. *)

Theorem naive_lookup_relateX:
  forall k t cts ,
    AbsX t cts -> lookup k t =  cts (Id k).
Abort.  (* Not true *)

(** In fact, [naive_lookup_relateX] is provably false,
     as long as the type [V] contains at least two different values. *)

Theorem not_naive_lookup_relateX:
   forall v, default <> v ->
    ~ (forall k t cts , AbsX t cts -> lookup k t =  cts (Id k)).
Proof.
unfold AbsX.
intros v H.
intros H0.
pose (bogus := T (T E 3 v E) 2 v E).
pose (m := t_update (t_update (t_empty default) (Id 2) v) (Id 3) v).
assert (list2map (elements bogus) = m).
  reflexivity.
assert (~ lookup 3 bogus = m (Id 3)). {
  unfold bogus, m, t_update, t_empty.
  simpl.
  apply H.
}
(** Right here you see how it is proved.  [bogus] is our old friend,
    the bogus tree that does not satisfy the [SearchTree] property.
    [m] is the [total_map] that corresponds to the elements of [bogus].
    The [lookup] function returns [default] at key [3],
    but the map [m] returns [v] at key [3].  And yet, assumption [H0]
    claims that they should return the same thing. *)
apply H2.
apply H0.
apply H1.
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, optional (lookup_relateX)  *)
Theorem lookup_relateX:
  forall k t cts ,
    SearchTree t -> AbsX t cts -> lookup k t =  cts (Id k).
Proof.
intros.
unfold AbsX in H0. subst cts.
inv H. remember 0 as lo in H0.
clear - H0.
rewrite elements_slow_elements.
(** To prove this, you'll need to use this collection of facts:
   [In_decidable], [list2map_app_left], [list2map_app_right],
   [list2map_not_in_default], [slow_elements_range].  The point is,
   it's not very pretty. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Coherence with [elements] instead of [lookup] *)
(** The first definition of the abstraction relation, [Abs], is "coherent"
     with the [lookup] operation, but not very coherent with the [elements]
     operation.  That is, [Abs] treats all trees, including ill-formed ones,
     much the way [lookup] does, so it was easy to prove [lookup_relate].
     But it was harder to prove [elements_relate].

    The alternate abstraction relation, [AbsX], is coherent with [elements],
    but not very coherent with [lookup].  So proving [elements_relateX] is
    trivial, but proving [lookup_relate] is difficult.

    This kind of thing comes up frequently.  The important thing to remember
    is that you often have choices in formulating the abstraction relation,
    and the choice you make will affect the simplicity and elegance of your
    proofs.   If you find things getting too difficult, step back and reconsider
    your abstraction relation. *)
