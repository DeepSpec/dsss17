(** * Perm: Basic techniques for permutations and ordering *)

(** Consider these algorithms and data structures:
 - sort a sequence of numbers;
 - finite maps from numbers to (arbitrary-type) data
 - finite maps from any ordered type to (arbitrary-type) data
 - priority queues: finding/deleting the highest number in a set

 To prove the correctness of such programs, we need to reason
 about less-than comparisons (for example, on integers) and about
 "these two sets/sequences have the same contents".  In this
 chapter, we introduce some techniques for reasoning about:
 - less-than comparisons on natural numbers
 - permutations (rearrangements of lists)
 Then, in later chapters, we'll apply these proof techniques
 to reasoning about algorithms and data structures.

(** That is, [reflect P b] means that [P<->True] if and only if [b=true].
     The way to use [reflect] is, for each of your operators, make a
     lemma like these next three:
*)

Lemma beq_reflect : forall x y, reflect (x = y) (x =? y).
Proof.
  intros x y.
  apply iff_reflect. symmetry.  apply beq_nat_true_iff.
Qed.

Lemma blt_reflect : forall x y, reflect (x < y) (x <? y).
Proof.
  intros x y.
  apply iff_reflect. symmetry. apply Nat.ltb_lt.
Qed.

Lemma ble_reflect : forall x y, reflect (x <= y) (x <=? y).
Proof.
  intros x y.
  apply iff_reflect. symmetry. apply Nat.leb_le.
Qed.

(** Here's an example of how you could use these lemmas.
    Suppose you have this simple program, [(if a <? 5 then a else 2)],
    and you want to prove that it evaluates to a number smaller than 6.
    You can use [blt_reflect] "by hand": *)

Example reflect_example1: forall a, (if a<?5 then a else 2) < 6.
Proof.
  intros.

  * (* Notice that [H] above the line has a [Prop]ositional
       fact _related_ to [a<?5]*)

  * (* Notice that [H] above the line has a a _different_
       [Prop]ositional fact. *)
     apply not_lt in H.  (* This step is not necessary,
          it just makes the hypothesis [H] look pretty *)
     omega.
Qed.

(** But there's another way to use [blt_reflect], etc: read on. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Some advanced tactical hacking. *)
(** You may skip ahead to "Inversion/clear/subst".
     Right here, we build some machinery that you'll want to
     _use_, but you won't need to know how to _build_ it.

    Let's put several of these [reflect] lemmas into a Hint database,
    called [bdestruct] because we'll use it in our boolean-destruction
    tactic: *)

Hint Resolve blt_reflect ble_reflect beq_reflect : bdestruct.

(** Our high-tech _boolean destruction_ tactic: *)

Ltac bdestruct X :=
  let H := fresh in let e := fresh "e" in
   evar (e: Prop);
   assert (H: reflect e X); subst e;
    [eauto with bdestruct
    | destruct H as [H|H];
       [ | try first [apply not_lt in H | apply not_le in H]]].

(** Here's a brief example of how to use [bdestruct].  There
     are more examples later. *)

Example reflect_example2: forall a, (if a<?5 then a else 2) < 6.
Proof.

     omega.  (* More explanation of [omega] later in this chapter. *)
  * (* Notice that [H] above the line has a a _different_
       [Prop]ositional fact. We don't need to apply [not_lt],
       as [bdestruct] has already done it. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inversion/clear/subst *)
(** Coq's [inversion H] tactic is so good at extracting information
    from the hypothesis [H] that [H] becomes completely redundant,
    and one might as well [clear] it from the goal.  Then, since the
    [inversion] typically creates some equality facts, why not then
    [subst] ?   This motivates the following useful tactic, [inv]:  *)

Ltac inv H := inversion H; clear H; subst.

(** ** Linear integer inequalities *)

(** In our proofs about searching and sorting algorithms, we
    sometimes have to reason about the consequences of
    less-than and greater-than.  Here's a contrived example. *)

Module Exploration1.

Theorem omega_example1:
 forall i j k,
    i < j ->
    ~ (k - 3 <= j) ->
   k > i.
Proof.
  intros.

(** Now, there's a hard way to prove this, and an easy way.
    Here's the hard way. *)

     natural numbers with "bogus subtraction." *)

  (* [specialize] applies a hypothesis to an argument *)

  simpl in H. inversion H.
Qed.

(** With bogus subtraction, this omega_example1 theorem even True?
    Yes it is; let's try again, the hard way, to find the proof. *)

Theorem omega_example1:
 forall i j k,
    i < j ->
    ~ (k - 3 <= j) ->
   k > i.
Proof. (* try again! *)
  intros.
  apply not_le in H0.

  apply le_minus.
Qed.  (* Oof!  That was exhausting and tedious.  *)

(** And here's the easy way. *)

Theorem omega_example2:
 forall i j k,
    i < j ->
    ~ (k - 3 <= j) ->
   k > i.
Proof.
  intros.
  omega.
Qed.

(** Here we have used the [omega] tactic, made available by importing
    [Coq.omega.Omega] as we have done above.  Omega is an algorithm
    for integer linear programming, invented in 1991 by William Pugh.
    Because ILP is NP-complete, we might expect that this algorithm is
    exponential-time in the worst case, and indeed that's true: if you
    have [N] equations, it could take [2^N] time.  But in the typical
    cases that result from reasoning about programs, omega is much
    faster than that.  Coq's [omega] tactic is an implementation of
    this algorithm that generates a machine-checkable Coq proof.  It
    "understands" the types Z and nat, and these operators: [<] [=] [>] [<=]
    [>=] [+] [-] [~], as well as multiplication by small integer
    literals (such as 0,1,2,3...) and some uses of [\/] and [/\].

    Omega does _not_ understand other operators.  It treats things
    like [a*b] and [f x y] as if they were variables.  That is, it can
    prove [f x y > a*b -> f x y + 3 >= a*b], in the same way it would
    prove [u > v -> u+3 >= v].

    Now let's consider a silly little program: swap the first two
    elements of a list, if they are out of order. *)

Definition maybe_swap (al: list nat) : list nat :=
  match al with
  | a :: b :: ar => if a >? b then b::a::ar else a::b::ar
  | _ => al
  end.

Example maybe_swap_123:
  maybe_swap [1; 2; 3] = [1; 2; 3].
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example maybe_swap_321:
  maybe_swap [3; 2; 1] = [2; 3; 1].
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** In this program, we wrote [a>?b] instead of [a>b].  Why is that? *)

Check (1>2).  (* : Prop *)
Check (1>?2). (* : bool *)

(** We cannot compute with elements of [Prop]: we need some kind of
    constructible (and pattern-matchable) value.  For that we use
    [bool]. *)

Locate ">?".  (* a >? b :=  ltb b a *)

(** The name [ltb] stands for "less-than boolean." *)

Print Nat.ltb.
(* =  fun n m : nat => S n <=? m : nat -> nat -> bool  *)
Locate ">=?".

(** Instead of defining an operator [Nat.geb], the standard library just
    defines the notation for greater-or-equal-boolean as a
    less-or-equal-boolean with the arguments swapped. *)

Locate leb.
Print leb.
Print Nat.leb.  (* The computation to compare natural numbers. *)

(** Here's a theorem: [maybe_swap] is idempotent -- that is, applying it
    twice gives the same result as applying it once. *)

Theorem maybe_swap_idempotent:
  forall al, maybe_swap (maybe_swap al) = maybe_swap al.
Proof.
  intros.
  destruct al as [ | a al].
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
  destruct al as [ | b al].
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
  simpl.

  (** What do we do here?   We must proceed by case analysis on
     whether a>b. *)

  destruct (b <? a) eqn:H.
  simpl.
  destruct (a <? b) eqn:H0.

  (** Now what?  Look at the hypotheses [H: b<a] and [H0: a<b]
      above the line. They can't both be true.  In fact, [omega]
      "knows" how to prove that kind of thing.  Let's try it: *)

  try omega.

  (** [omega] didn't work, because it operates on comparisons in [Prop],
      such as [a>b]; not upon comparisons yielding bool, such as [a>?b].
      We need to convert these comparisons to [Prop], so that we can use
      [omega].

      Actually, we don't "need" to.  Instead, we could reason directly
      about these operations in [bool].  But that would be even more
      tedious than the [omega_example1] proof.  Therefore: let's set up
      some machinery so that we can use [omega] on boolean tests. *)

Abort.

(** Let's try again, a new way: *)

Theorem maybe_swap_idempotent:
  forall al, maybe_swap (maybe_swap al) = maybe_swap al.
Proof.
  intros.
  destruct al as [ | a al].
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
  destruct al as [ | b al].
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
  simpl.

  (** This is where we left off before. Now, watch: *)

  destruct (blt_reflect b a).   (* THIS LINE *)
  (* Notice that [b<a] is above the line as a Prop, not a bool.
     Now, comment out THIS LINE, and uncomment THAT LINE.  *)
  (* bdestruct (b <? a).    (* THAT LINE *) *)
  (* THAT LINE, with [bdestruct], does the same thing as THIS LINE. *)
* (* case b<a *)
  simpl.
  bdestruct (a <? b).
  omega.

  (** The [omega] tactic noticed that above the line we have an
      arithmetic contradiction.  Perhaps it seems wasteful to bring
      out the "big gun" to shoot this flea, but really, it's easier
      than remembering the names of all those lemmas about
      arithmetic! *)

  reflexivity.
* (* case a >= b *)
  simpl.
  bdestruct (b <? a).
  omega.

Qed.

(** Moral of this story: When proving things about a program that uses
    boolean comparisons [(a <? b)], use [bdestruct].  Then use
    [omega].  Let's review that proof without all the comments. *)

(** * Permutations *)

(** Another useful fact about [maybe_swap] is that it doesn't add or
    remove elements from the list: it only reorders them.  We can say
    that the output list is a _permutation_ of the input.  The Coq
    [Permutation] library has an inductive definition of permutations,
    along with some lemmas about them. *)

(** You might wonder, "is that really the right definition?"  And
    indeed, it's important that we get a right definition, because
    [Permutation] is going to be used in the specification of
    correctness of our searching and sorting algorithms.  If we have
    the wrong specification, then all our proofs of "correctness" will
    be useless.

    It's not obvious that this is indeed the right specification of
    permutations. (It happens to be true, but it's not obvious!)  In
    order to gain confidence that we have the right specification, we
    should use this specification to prove some properties that we
    think permutations ought to have. *)
