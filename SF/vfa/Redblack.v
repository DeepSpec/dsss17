(** Red-black trees are a form of binary search tree (BST), but with
     _balance_.   Recall that the _depth_ of a node in a tree is the
    distance from the root to that node.  The _height_ of a tree is
    the depth of the deepest node.  The [insert] or [lookup] function
    of the BST algorithm (Chapter [SearchTree]) takes time
    proportional to the depth of the node that is found (or inserted).
    To make these functions run fast, we want trees where the
    worst-case depth (or the average depth) is as small as possible.

    In a perfectly balanced tree of N nodes, every node has depth less
    than or or equal to log N, using logarithms base 2.   In an
    approximately balanced tree, every node has depth less than or
    equal to 2 log N.  That's good enough to make [insert] and [lookup]
    run in time proportional to log N.

    The trick is to mark the nodes Red and Black, and by these marks
    to know when to locally rebalance the tree.  For more explanation
    and pictures, see the Required Reading above.

(** The [balance] function is copied directly from Okasaki's paper.
  Now, the nice thing about machine-checked proof in Coq is that you
  can prove this correct without actually understanding it!
  So, do read Okasaki's paper, but don't worry too much about the details
  of this [balance] function.

  In contrast, Sedgewick has proposed _left-leaning red-black trees_,
  which have a simpler balance function (but a more complicated invariant).
  He does this in order to make the proof of correctness easier: there
  are fewer cases in the [balance] function, and therefore fewer cases
  in the case-analysis of the proof of correctness of [balance].  But as you
  will see, our proofs about [balance] will have automated case analyses,
  so we don't care how many cases there are! *)

(** Now that the program has been defined, it's time to prove its properties.
   A red-black tree has two kinds of properties:
  - [SearchTree]: the keys in each left subtree are all less than the
       node's key, and the keys in each right subtree are greater
  - [Balanced]:  there is the same number of black nodes on any path from
     the root to each leaf; and there are never two red nodes in a row.

  First, we'll treat the [SearchTree] property. *)

             Take note: with just this one clause, how many subgoals remain?
   -2. Whenever [Abs (T _ _ _ _ _) _] is above the line, invert it.
             Take note: with just these two clause, how many subgoals remain?
   -3. Whenever [SearchTree' _ E _] is above the line, invert it.
             Take note after this step and each step: how many subgoals remain?
   -4. Same for [SearchTree' _ (T _ _ _ _ _) _].
   -5. When [Abs match c with Red => _ | Black => _ end _] is below the line,
          [destruct c].
   -6. When [Abs match s with E => _ | T ... => _ end _] is below the line,
          [destruct s].
   -7. Whenever [Abs (T _ _ _ _ _) _] is below the line,
                  prove it by [apply Abs_T].   This won't always work;
         Sometimes the "cts" in the proof goal does not exactly match the form
         of the "cts" required by the [Abs_T] constructor.  But it's all right if
         a clause fails; in that case, the [match goal] will just try the next clause.
          Take note, as usual: how many clauses remain?
   -8.  Whenever [Abs E _] is below the line, solve it by [apply Abs_E].
   -9.  Whenever the current proof goal matches a hypothesis above the line,
          just use it.  That is, just add this clause:
       | |- _ => assumption
   -10.  At this point, if all has gone well, you should have exactly 21 subgoals.
       Each one should be of the form, [  Abs (T ...) (t_update...) ]
       What you want to do is replace (t_update...) with a different "contents"
       that matches the form required by the Abs_T constructor.
       In the first proof goal, do this: [eapply Abs_helper].
       Notice that you have two subgoals.
       The first subgoal you can prove by:
           apply Abs_T. apply Abs_T. apply Abs_E. apply Abs_E.
           apply Abs_T. eassumption. eassumption.
       Step through that, one at a time, to see what it's doing.
       Now, undo those 7 commands, and do this instead:
            repeat econstructor; eassumption.
       That solves the subgoal in exactly the same way.
       Now, wrap this all up, by adding this clause to your [match goal]:
       | |- _ =>  eapply Abs_helper; [repeat econstructor; eassumption | ]
   -11.  You should still have exactly 21 subgoals, each one of the form,
             [ t_update... = t_update... ].  Notice above the line you have some
           assumptions of the form,  [ H: SearchTree' lo _ hi ].  For this equality
         proof, we'll need to know that [lo <= hi].  So, add a clause at the end
        of your [match goal] to apply SearchTree'_le in any such assumption,
        when below the line the proof goal is an equality [ _ = _ ].
   -12.  Still exactly 21 subgoals.  In the first subgoal, try:
          [contents_equivalent_prover].   That should solve the goal.
          Look above, at [Ltac contents_equivalent_prover], to see how it works.
          Now, add a clause to  [match goal] that does this for all the subgoals.

(** * Proving efficiency. *)

(** Red-black trees are supposed to be more efficient than ordinary search trees,
   because they stay balanced.  In a perfectly balanced tree, any two leaves
   have exactly the same depth, or the difference in depth is at most 1.
   In an approximately balanced tree, no leaf is more than twice as deep as
   another leaf.   Red-black trees are approximately balanced.
   Consequently, no node is more then 2logN deep, and the run time for
   insert or lookup is bounded by a constant times 2logN.

   We can't prove anything _directly_ about the run time, because we don't
   have a cost model for Coq functions.  But we can prove that the trees
   stay approximately balanced; this tells us important information about
   their efficiency. *)

Proof.

destruct (IHs1 n); clear IHs1.
destruct (IHs2 n); clear IHs2.
specialize (H0 H6).

(** You will need proof automation, in a similar style to
   the proofs of [ins_not_E] and [balance_relate]. *)

(** * Extracting and measuring red-black trees *)

Extraction "redblack.ml" empty_tree insert lookup elements.

(** You can run this inside the ocaml top level by:

#use "redblack.ml";;
#use "test_searchtree.ml";;
run_tests();;


On my machine, in the byte-code interpreter this prints,

Insert and lookup 1000000 random integers in 0.889 seconds.
Insert and lookup 20000 random integers in 0.016 seconds.
Insert and lookup 20000 consecutive integers in 0.015 seconds.


You can compile and run this with the ocaml native-code compiler by:

ocamlopt redblack.mli redblack.ml -open Redblack test_searchtree.ml -o test_redblack
./test_redblack


On my machine this prints,

Insert and lookup 1000000 random integers in 0.436 seconds.
Insert and lookup 20000 random integers in 0. seconds.
Insert and lookup 20000 consecutive integers in 0. seconds.

(** * Success! *)
(** The benchmark measurements above (and in Extract.v) demonstrate that:
  - On random insertions, red-black trees are slightly faster than ordinary BSTs
     (red-black 0.436 seconds, vs ordinary 0.468 seconds)
  - On consecutive insertions, red-black trees are _much_ faster than ordinary BSTs
     (red-black 0. seconds, vs ordinary 0.374 seconds)
  In particular, red-black trees are almost exactly as fast on the
     consecutive insertions (0.015 seconds) as on the random (0.016 seconds).
