(** * Selection:  Selection sort, with specification and proof of correctness*)
(**
  This sorting algorithm works by choosing (and deleting) the smallest
  element, then doing it again, and so on.  It takes O(N^2) time.

  You should never* use a selection sort.  If you want a simple
  quadratic-time sorting algorithm (for small input sizes) you should
  use insertion sort.  Insertion sort is simpler to implement, runs
  faster, and is simpler to prove correct.   We use selection sort here
  only to illustrate the proof techniques.

     *Well, hardly ever.  If the cost of "moving" an element is _much_
  larger than the cost of comparing two keys, then selection sort is
  better than insertion sort.  But this consideration does not apply in our
  setting, where the elements are  represented as pointers into the
  heap, and only the pointers need to be moved.

  What you should really never use is bubble sort.  Bubble sort
  would be the wrong way to go.  Everybody knows that!

(** * The selection-sort program  *)

Require Import Perm.

(** Find (and delete) the smallest element in a list. *)

Fixpoint select (x: nat) (l: list nat) : nat * list nat :=
match l with
|  nil => (x, nil)
|  h::t => if x <=? h
               then let (j, l') := select x t in (j, h::l')
               else let (j,l') := select h t in (j, x::l')
end.

(** Now, selection-sort works by repeatedly extracting the smallest element,
   and making a list of the results. *)

(* Uncomment this function, and try it.
Fixpoint selsort l :=
match l with
| i::r => let (j,r') := select i r
               in j :: selsort r'
| nil => nil
end.
*)

(** _Error: Recursive call to selsort has principal argument equal
  to [r'] instead of [r]_.  That is, the recursion is not _structural_, since
  the list r' is not a structural sublist of (i::r).  One way to fix the
  problem is to use Coq's [Function] feature, and prove that
  [length(r')<length(i::r)].  Later in this chapter, we'll show that approach.

  Instead, here we solve this problem is by providing "fuel", an additional
  argument that has no use in the algorithm except to bound the
  amount of recursion.  The [n] argument, below, is the fuel. *)

Fixpoint selsort l n {struct n} :=
match l, n with
| x::r, S n' => let (y,r') := select x r
               in y :: selsort r' n'
| nil, _ => nil
| _::_, O => nil  (* Oops!  Ran out of fuel! *)
end.

(** What happens if we run out of fuel before we reach the end
   of the list?  Then WE GET THE WRONG ANSWER. *)

Example out_of_gas: selsort [3;1;4;1;5] 3 <> [1;1;3;4;5].
Proof.

(** What happens if we have have too much fuel?  No problem. *)

(** The selection_sort algorithm provides just enough fuel. *)

(** * Recursive functions that are not structurally recursive *)

(** [Fixpoint] in Coq allows for recursive functions where some
  parameter is structurally recursive: in every call, the argument
  passed at that parameter position is an immediate substructure
  of the corresponding formal parameter.  For recursive functions
  where that is not the case -- but for which you can still prove
  that they terminate -- you can use a more advanced feature of
  Coq, called [Function]. *)

(** Important!  Don't unfold [selsort'], or in general, never
  unfold anything defined with [Function]. Instead, use the
