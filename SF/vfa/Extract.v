(** * Extract: Running Coq programs in ML *)

(** Coq's [Extraction] feature allows you to write a functional
    program inside Coq; (presumably) use Coq's logic to prove some
    correctness properties about it; then print it out as an ML (or
    Haskell) program that you can compile with your optimizing ML (or
    Haskell) compiler.

    The \CHAPV1{Extraction} chapter of _Logical Foundations_ gave a
    simple example of Coq's program extraction features.  In this
    chapter, we'll take a deeper look. *)

Require Import Perm.

Module Sort1.
Fixpoint insert (i:nat) (l: list nat) :=
  match l with
  | nil => i::nil
  | h::t => if i <=? h then i::h::t else h :: insert i t
 end.

Fixpoint sort (l: list nat) : list nat :=
  match l with
  | nil => nil
  | h::t => insert h (sort t)
end.

(** The [Extraction] command prints out a function as Ocaml code. *)

Extraction sort.

(** You can see the translation of "sort" from Coq to Ocaml,
    in the "Messages" window of your IDE.
   Examine it there, and notice the similarities and differences.

  However, we really want the whole program, including the [insert]
  function.  We get that as follows: *)

Recursive Extraction  sort.

(** The first thing you see there is a redefinition of the [bool] type.
  But Ocaml already has a [bool] type whose inductive structure is
  isomorphic.  We want our extracted functions to be compatible with,
  callable by, ordinary Ocaml code.  So we want to use Ocaml's standard
  notation for the inductive definition, [bool].  The following directive
  accomplishes that: *)

Extract Inductive bool => "bool" [ "true" "false" ].
Extract Inductive list => "list" [ "[]" "(::)" ].
Recursive Extraction  sort.

End Sort1.

(** This is better.  But the program still uses a unary representation of
  natural numbers:  the number 7 is really (S (S (S (S (S (S (S O))))))). which in
  Ocaml will be a data structure that's seven pointers deep.  The [leb] function
  takes time proportional to the difference in value between [n] and [m],
  which is terrible.  We'd like natural numbers to be represented as Ocaml [int].
  Unfortunately, there are only a finite number of [int] values in Ocaml
  (2^31, or 2^63, depending on your implementation); so there are things
  you could prove about some programs, in Coq, that wouldn't be true in Ocaml.

  There are two solutions to this problem:
  - Instead of using [nat], use a more efficient constructive type, such as [Z].
  - Instead of using [nat], use an _abstract type_, and instantiate it with
       Ocaml integers.

  The first alternative uses Coq's [Z] type, an inductive type with
  constructors [xI] [xH] etc.  [Z] represents 7 as [Zpos (xI (xI xH))],
  that is,  +(  1+2*(  1+2*  1 )).
  A number [n] is represented as a data structure of size log(n), and
  the operations (plus, less-than) also take about log(n) each.

  [Z]'s log-time per operation is much better than linear time; but in
  Ocaml we are used to having constant-time operations.  Thus, here
  we will explore the second alternative: program with abstract types,
  then use an extraction directive to get efficiency. *)

(** We will be using [Parameter] and [Axiom] in Coq.   You already saw
 these keywords, in a [Module Type], in the [ADT] chapter.
 There, they describe interface components that must be instantiated
 by any [Module] that satisfies the type.  Here, we will use this
 feature in a different (and more dangerous) way:  To axiomatize
 a mathematical theory without actually constructing it.  The reason
 that's dangerous is that if your axioms are inconsistent, then you
 can prove [False], or in fact, you can prove _anything_, so all your
 proofs are worthless.  So we must take care!

 Here, we will axiomatize a _very weak_ mathematical theory:
 We claim that there exists some type [int] with a function [ltb],
 so that [int] injects into [Z], and [ltb] corresponds to the < relation
 on Z.  That seems true enough (for example, take [int=Z]), but
 we're not _proving_ it here. *)

Parameter int : Type.  (* This is the Ocaml [int] type. *)
Extract Inlined Constant int => "int".  (* so, extract it that way! *)

Parameter ltb: int -> int -> bool.  (* This is the Ocaml (<) operator. *)
Extract Inlined Constant ltb => "(<)".  (* so, extract it that way! *)

(** Now, we need to axiomatize [ltb] so that we can reason about
  programs that use it.  We need to take great care here: the
  axioms had better be consistent with Ocaml's behavior, otherwise
  our proofs will be meaningless.

  One axiomatization of [ltb] is just that it's a total order, irreflexive
  and transitive.  This would work just fine.  But instead, I choose to
  claim that there's an injection from "int" into the mathematical integers,
  Coq's [Z] type.  The reason to do this is then we get to use the [omega]
  tactic, and other Coq libraries about integer comparisons. *)

Parameter int2Z: int -> Z.
Axiom ltb_lt : forall n m : int, ltb n m = true <-> int2Z n < int2Z m.

(** Both of these axioms are sound.  There does (abstractly) exist a
  function from "int" to [Z], and that function _is_ consistent with
  the [ltb_lt] axiom.  But you should think about this until you are
  convinced.

  Notice that we do not give extraction directives for [int2Z] or [ltb_lt].
  That's because they will not appear in _programs_, only in proofs that
  are not meant to be extracted.

  Now, here's a dangerous axiom:

  [Parameter ocaml_plus : int -> int -> int.]

  [Extract Inlined Constant ocaml_plus => "(+)".]

  [Axiom ocaml_plus_plus:
     forall a b c: int,
       ocaml_plus a b = c <-> int2Z a + int2Z b = int2Z c.]

  The first two lines are OK:  there really is a "+" function in Ocaml,
  and its type really is  [int -> int -> int].

  But [ocaml_plus_plus] is unsound!   From it, you could prove,

  [(int2Z max_int + int2Z max_int) = int2Z (ocaml_plus max_int max_int)],

  which is not true in Ocaml, because overflow wraps around, modulo
  [2^(wordsize-1)].

  So we won't axiomatize Ocaml addition. *)
