(** * Language specification and variable binding *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** This tutorial demonstrates the use of the Coq proof assistant for
    reasoning about higher-order programming languages, such as those based
    on the lambda calculus, and their implementations. We use a
    simply-typed lambda calculus as a running example.

    Reasoning about languages with first-class functions is difficult because
    of variable binding. In particular, there are two important
    complications that make working with lambda-terms difficult.

  - First, we would like to work up to _alpha-equivalence_. In other words, we
    would like our reasoning about lambda terms to not depend on the names
    that we use for free variables.

    For example, we would like to show that these two terms are
    indistinguishable to the semantics

              [\x.x]  and  [\y.y]

  - Second, substitution should be _capture avoiding_. When we substitute
    terms with free variables, those free variables should never become bound
    by the terms they are being substituted into. This means that sometimes we
    need to rename bound variables to avoid capture. For example,

          [  [ z ~> \x.y ](\y.z) ]    should be   [  \y1.\x.y ]
*)

(** ** Approaches to variable binding

    Unfortunately, variable binding is an _old_ problem. The issue isn't that
    we don't know how to solve this problem, in fact there are _many_, _many_
    different ways to solve this problem and they all have their trade offs.
    I won't include an entire taxonomy of solutions here, but before we go
    further, I want to mention a few relevant alternatives.

    - Only working with closed terms, never reasoning about equivalence

    If we never have to substitute an _open_ term, then we never have to worry
    about variable capture. We can represent binding variables in lambda terms
    using names in a straightforward manner. This approach is the simplest and
    side-steps the two problems shown above. For example, it can be used to
    show type soundness, as is done in Software Foundations.

    However, this approach does not scale. For example, reasoning about
    compiler optimizations requires reasoning about the equivalence of
    transformed open terms.

    - Named terms, with swapping

    We can still work with named terms, even in the presence of free
    variables, as long as we _define_ alpha equivalence and substitution
    appropriately. There are, again, many approaches to these definitions.
    However, the most elegant approach is inspired by Nominal Logic.

    - Locally nameless representation (LN)

    When working in Coq, it is convenient to use a representation that makes
    all alpha-equivalent terms _definitionally_ equivalent. LN does this while
    still providing an interface that is mostly similar to paper proofs.

Other approaches to variable binding include de Bruijn indices, de Bruijn
levels, weak HOAS, PHOAS, locally named, canonically named... etc. Of these,
de Bruijn representations are by far the most commonly used representation in
Coq. *)

(** ** Overview

In this tutorial, we will promote the following approach to variable binding.

- Use a locally nameless representation to _specify_ and reason about the
  semantics

- Use a named representation to _implement_ environment-based interpreters for
  lambda calculus terms. If binders are mostly unique, then this
  implementation avoids additional work.

- The definitions, lemmas and proofs that are needed to work with
  lambda-calculus terms are highly automatable.


In the first part of the tutorial, we will demonstrate the use of a locally
nameless representation to reason about a specification of a call-by-name
lambda calculus. We will state the operational semantics of this language
using a small-step substitution-based inductive relation.  We will use this
specification for metatheoretic reasoning: we will prove _preservation_ and
_progress_ as in Software Foundations.

Next, we will represent the same language using a _nominal representation_ but
specify the semantics using an abstract machine. This abstract machine is
given as a Coq function from machine configurations to machine configurations,
and can be used as an efficient interpreter. This abstract machine features a
heap (i.e. runtime environment for variables) so we will not need to define
capture-avoiding substitution as part of our semantics.

Finally, we will prove that the abstract machine implements the same semantics
as the locally nameless based substitution semantics. *)

(** ** Tool support

The development of this tutorial draws from two coordinating tools that
support working with LN representations.

The Ott tool provides a direct way of generating LN language definitions from
a simple specification language.  The file [stlc.ott] contains the input
specification of the language of this tutorial.  [Definitions.v] is a
commented version of the Ott output. (For comparison, the raw output is in
[Stlc.v]).  The same specifications can also be used to produce LaTeX macros
for typesetting language definitions, demonstrated in [stlc.pdf].


The LNgen tool works with Ott to generate a number of lemmas and auxiliary
definitions for working with LN terms. The file [Lemmas.v] is commented
version of that output. (For comparison, the raw output is in [Stlc_inf.v].)

(** ** Encoding STLC terms *)
(*************************************************************************)


(** We start with examples of encodings in STLC.

  For example, we can encode the expression [(\x. Y x)] as below. We use the
  index [0] because it refers to the closest [abs] to the bound variable
  occurrence. *)

Definition demo_rep1 := abs (app (var_f Y) (var_b 0)).
(*                       ^                        |                   *)
(*                       |                        |                   *)
(*                       --------------------------                   *)



(**  Here is another example: the encoding of [(\x. \y. (y x))].      *)

Definition demo_rep2 := abs (abs (app (var_b 0) (var_b 1))).
(*                       ^    ^              |         |              *)
(*                       |    |              |         |              *)
(*                       |    ----------------         |              *)
(*                       |                             |              *)
(*                       -------------------------------              *)

(** Finally, here is an example where the same bound variable has two
    different indices, and the same index refers to two different
    bound variables.
                         [\y. ((\x. (x y)) y)]                        *)

Definition demo_rep3 :=
           abs (app (abs (app (var_b 0) (var_b 1))) (var_b 0)).
(*          ^         ^              |         |           |          *)
(*          |         |              |         |           |          *)
(*          |         ----------------         |           |          *)
(*          |                                  |           |          *)

(** *** Exercise: term representation

    Define the following lambda calculus terms using the locally
	 nameless representation.

       "two" : \s. \z. s (s z)

       "COMB_K" : \x. \y. x

       "COMB_S" : \x. \y. \z. x z (y z)

*)

(* FILL IN HERE *)

(** There are two important advantages of the locally nameless
    representation:
     - Alpha-equivalent terms have a unique representation.
       We're always working up to alpha-equivalence.
     - Operations such as free variable substitution and free
       variable calculation have simple recursive definitions
       (and therefore are simple to reason about).

    Weighed against these advantages are two drawbacks:
     - The [exp] datatype admits terms, such as [abs 3], where
       indices are unbound.
       A term is called "locally closed" when it contains
       no unbound indices.
     - We must define *both* bound variable & free variable
       substitution and reason about how these operations
       interact with each other.
*)


(*************************************************************************)
(** ** Substitution *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** The substitution function replaces a free variable with a term.  For
    simplicity, we define a notation for free variable substitution that
    mimics standard mathematical notation.  *)

Check [Y ~> var_f Z](abs (app (var_b 0)(var_f Y))).

(** To demonstrate how free variable substitution works, we need to
    reason about var equality.
*)
Check (Y == Z).

(** The decidable var equality function returns a sum. If the two
    vars are equal, the left branch of the sum is returned, carrying
    a proof of the proposition that the vars are equal.  If they are
    not equal, the right branch includes a proof of the disequality.

    The demo below uses three new tactics:
    - The tactic [simpl] reduces a Coq expression to its normal
      form.
    - The tactic [destruct (Y==Y)] considers the two possible
      results of the equality test.
*)

Example demo_subst1:
  [Y ~> var_f Z] (abs (app (var_b 0) (var_f Y))) = (abs (app (var_b 0) (var_f Z))).
Proof.
(* WORKED IN CLASS *)

  destruct (Y==Y).
  - auto.
  - destruct n. auto.

(** *** Exercise [subst_eq_var]

    We can use almost the same proof script as
    above to show how substitution works in the variable case. Try it
    on your own.  *)

(** ** Free variables *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** The function [fv_exp] calculates the set of free variables in an
    expression.  This function returns a value of type `atoms` --- a finite
    set of variable names.  *)

   The tactic [fsetdec] solves a certain class of propositions
   involving finite sets. See the documentation in [FSetWeakDecide]
   for a full specification.

  x `in` (singleton x `union` S).

  fsetdec.
Qed.

(** *** Recommended Exercise [subst_exp_fresh_eq]

    To show the ease of reasoning with these definitions, we will prove a
    standard result from lambda calculus: if a variable does not appear free
    in a term, then substituting for it has no effect.

    HINTS: Prove this lemma by induction on [e].

    - You will need to use [simpl] in many cases.  You can [simpl] everything
      everywhere (including hypotheses) with the pattern [simpl in *].

    - Part of this proof includes a false assumption about free variables.
      Destructing this hypothesis produces a goal about finite set membership
      that is solvable by [fsetdec].

    - The [f_equal] tactic converts a goal of the form [f e1 = f e1'] in to
      one of the form [e1 = e1'], and similarly for [f e1 e2 = f e1' e2'],
      etc.  *)

   Step through the proof that free variables are not introduced by substitution.

   This proof actually is very automatable ([simpl in *; auto.] takes care of

   parts of the finite set library. These two parts are the tactic
   [destruct_notin] and the lemma [notin_union], both defined in the module
   [FSetWeakNotin].

   about those definitions and see what other finite set reasoning is

(** This next demo shows the operation of [open].  For example, the

    [abs (app (abs (app 1 0)) 0)].  To look at the body _without_ the
    outer abstraction, we need to replace the indices that refer to
    that abstraction with a name.  Therefore, we show that we can open
    the body of the abs above with [Y] to produce
    [app (abs (app Y 0)) Y)].

(** The most important properties about open and lc_exp concern their

    free and bound variable substitution.

    We won't prove this lemma as part of the tutorial (it is proved in
    [Lemmas.v]), but it is an important building block for reasoning about
    LN terms.

    NOTE: the name of this lemma was automatically generated by LNgen. If
    we have multiple syntactic classes and multiple sorts of variables,
    we need to distinguish the different forms of substitution from
    eachother.

(** The lemma above is most often used with [e2] as some fresh
    variable. Therefore, it simplifies matters to define the following useful

(** This next lemma states that opening can be replaced with variable
    opening and substitution.

    This lemma, like many about [open_exp_wrt_exp], should be proven
    via induction on the term [e]. However, during this induction, the
    binding depth of the term changes, so to make sure that we have
    a flexible enough induction hypothesis, we must generalize the
    argument to [open_exp_wrt_exp_rec].  *)

(** Let's look more closely at lc_abs and lc_exp_ind. *)

Check lc_exp_ind.

(** The induction principle for the lc_exp relation is particularly strong
   in the abs case.

<<
 forall P : exp -> Prop,

  This principle says that to prove that a property holds for an abstraction,
  we can assume that the property holds for the body of the abstraction,
  opened with *any* variable that we like.

*)


Check lc_abs.

(** However, on the other hand, when we show that an abstraction is locally
   closed, we need to show that its body is locally closed, when
   opened by any variable.

   That can sometimes be a problem. *)

    to show that the body of the abstraction is locally closed,
