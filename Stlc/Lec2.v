(** * Typing contexts *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** We represent contexts as association lists (lists of pairs of
    keys and values) whose keys are [atom]s.   *)

(** For STLC, contexts bind [atom]s to [typ]s.  We define an
    abbreviation [ctx] for the type of these contexts.

    Lists are defined in Coq's standard library, with the constructors
    [nil] and [cons].  The list library includes the [::] notation
    for cons as well as standard list operations such as append, map,
    and fold. The infix operation "++" is list append.

    The Metatheory library extends this reasoning by instantiating the
    AssocList library to provide support for association lists whose
    keys are [atom]s.  Everything in this library is polymorphic over
    the type of objects bound in the context.  Look in AssocList
    for additional details about the functions and predicates that we
    mention below.  *)

(** Context equality *)

(** When reasoning about contexts, we often need to talk about
    bindings in the "middle" of a context. Therefore, it is common
    for lemmas and definitions to use list append in their statements.
    Unfortunately, list append is associative, so two Coq expressions may
    denote the same context even though they are not equal.

    The tactic [simpl_env] reassociates all concatenations of
    contexts to the right.  *)

(** To make contexts easy to read, instead of building them from
    [nil] and [cons], we prefer to build them from the following
    components:
      - [nil]: The empty list.
      - [one]: Lists consisting of exactly one item.
      - [++]:  List append.
*)

(** The simpl_env tactic actually puts lists built from only nil, one
    and [++] into a "normal form". This process reassociates all appends
    to the right, removes extraneous nils and converts cons to singleton
    lists with an append.
*)

(** * Typing relation and cofinite quantification *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** The typing relation in the STLC definition states the typing rule for
    abstractions in a particular way.

<<
typing_abs
     : forall (L : atoms) (G : ctx) (T1 : typ) (e : exp) (T2 : typ),
       (forall x : atom,
        x `notin` L -> typing ([(x, T1)] ++ G) (open e (var_f x)) T2) ->
       typing G (abs e) (typ_arrow T1 T2)
>>

   To show that abstractions are well-typed, we must show that the body
   of the abstraction is well-typed for any choice of variable, except
   those from some unspecified set `L`.

   This type of rule differs from the quantification in the
   [lc_abs] rule (which does not restrict the variables at all) or
   the [lc_abs_exists] version (which only applies for one particular
   variable. We call this version "co-finite" quantification.

   To see why this version is necessary, we will start with a more
   traditional version of the rules that only uses a single variable
   in the abs rule and then see what goes wrong.
   (We say that the [typing_e] judgement below uses "exists-fresh"
   quantification in the abs rule.)

(** ** Weakening  *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** Weakening states that if an expression is typeable in some
    context, then it is typeable in any well-formed extension of
    that context.  This property is needed to prove the
    substitution lemma.

    As stated below, this lemma is not directly proveable.  The
    natural way to try proving this lemma proceeds by induction on the
    typing derivation for [e].
*)

  typing_e (F ++ E) e T.
Proof.
  intros E F e T H J.
  induction H; auto.
  - Case "typing_abs".
    apply (typing_e_abs x).
    (* ... stuck here ... *)

(** We are stuck in the [typing_abs] case because the induction
    hypothesis [IHtyping_e] applies only when we weaken the context at its
    head.  In this case, however, we need to weaken the context in
    the middle; compare the conclusion at the point where we're stuck
    to the hypothesis [H], which comes from the given typing derivation.

    We can obtain a more useful induction hypothesis by changing the
    statement to insert new bindings into the middle of the
    context, instead of at the head.  However, the proof still
    gets stuck, as can be seen by examining each of the cases in
    the proof below.

    Note: To view subgoal n in a proof, use the command "[Show n]".
    To work on subgoal n instead of the first one, use the command
    "[Focus n]".
*)

Lemma typing_weakening_strengthened_0 : forall (E F G : ctx) e T,
  typing_e (G ++ E) e T ->
  uniq (G ++ F ++ E) ->
  typing_e (G ++ F ++ E) e T.

    (* The G0 looks strange in the [typing_var] case. *)
  Focus 2.
  Case "typing_abs".
    (* The [typing_abs] case still does not have a strong enough IH. *)
Abort.

(** The hypotheses in the [typing_var] case include a context
    [G0] that that has no relation to what we need to prove.  The
    missing fact we need is that [G0 = (G ++ E)].

    The problem here arises from the fact that Coq's [induction]
    tactic lets us only prove something about all typing derivations.
    While it's clear to us that weakening applies to all typing
    derivations, it's not clear to Coq, because the context is
    written using concatenation.  The [induction] tactic expects that
    all arguments to a judgement are variables.  So we see [E0] in the
    proof instead of [(G ++ E)].

    The solution is to restate the lemma.  For example, we can prove

<<
  forall E F E' e T, typing E' e T ->
  forall G, E' = G ++ E -> uniq (G ++ F ++ E) -> typing (G ++ F ++ E) e T.
>>

    The equality gets around the problem with Coq's [induction]
    tactic.  The placement of the [(forall G)] quantifier gives us a
    sufficiently strong induction hypothesis in the [typing_abs] case.

    However, we prefer not to state the lemma in the way shown above,
    since it is not as readable as the original statement.  Instead,
    we use a tactic to introduce the equality within the proof itself.
    The tactic [(remember t as t')] replaces an object [t] with the
    identifier [t'] everywhere in the goal and introduces an equality
    [t' = t] into the context.  It is often combined with [generalize
    dependent], as illustrated below.
*)

Lemma typing_weakening_strengthened_1 :  forall (E F G : ctx) e T,
  typing_e (G ++ E) e T ->
  uniq (G ++ F ++ E) ->
  typing_e (G ++ F ++ E) e T.

  - Case "typing_var". auto.
  - Case "typing_abs".
    eapply (typing_e_abs x).
    (* STILL STUCK! *)
Abort.

Print typing_abs.

(** At this point, we are very close. However, there is still one issue. We
    cannot show that [x] is fresh for the weakened context [F].

    This is the difficulty with the definition of [typing_e]. As in the local
    closure judgement, the induction hypotheses is not strong enough in the
    [abs] case.

    However, this time, we take a slightly different solution, with the
    cofinite quantification of the [typing_abs] rule.

<<
| typing_abs :
    forall (L : atoms) (G : ctx) (T1 : typ) (e : exp) (T2 : typ),
    (forall x, x `notin` L -> typing ([(x, T1)] ++ G) (e ^ x) T2) ->
    typing (abs e) (typ_arrow T1 T2) >>
>>

   The advantage of this definition is that it is easier to derive
   the "exists-fresh" version of the rule
   [typing_e_abs] as a lemma, than the version we used in [lc_exp].
   (See below, we prove this lemma after we show substitution.) At the same
   time, this version of the rule is sufficiently expressive to complete
   the proof of weakening.

    The tactic [gather_atoms] is used to collect together all the
    atoms in the context.  It relies on an auxiliary tactic,
    [gather_atoms_with] (from MetatheoryAtom), which maps a function
    that returns a finite set of atoms over all hypotheses with the

(** A number of other, useful tactics are defined by the Metatheory

    [gather_atoms], denoted by the [::=] in its definition below, we
    automatically update these tactics so that they use the proper
    notion of "all atoms in the context."

    For example, the tactic [(pick fresh x)] chooses an atom fresh for

   We also want a property that states that the free variables of well-typed
   terms are contained within the domain of their typing contexts.
